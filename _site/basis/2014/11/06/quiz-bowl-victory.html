<h2>Quiz Bowl Victory</h2>
<h4>By George Yang</h4>

<p>At 8:30 a.m. exactly on a Saturday morning, on October 25, the Arizona Quiz Bowl Association Tournament commenced. Groups of students, followed by a few stragglers, entered the ASU Durham Language Literature Building. Climbing the stairs, many appeared completely comfortable—the epitome of professionalism. Some reviewed eclectic fact sheets; others drilled each other. An undercurrent of chatter filled the small space in the cold building. The overall vibe, as BASIS Scottsdale “B” Team Captain Max Rosenberg divulged, was “excited, anxious, and pretty quiet.”</p>

<p>This process seemed familiar to many. For BASIS Quiz Bowl veterans, it was easy to distinguish the foreign and familiar faces: the overpopulated Desert Vista team; the number one team from California, San Diego Olympian Science; and most importantly—for “A” Team Captain Alex Cohen—”that kid that looks like Bubble Bass.”</p>

<p>Their relaxation was warranted. Each Quiz Bowl round lasted ten and-a-half minutes; in contrast, weekly Thursday practices at BASIS Scottsdale stretch one-hourlong, with practices entailing five rounds at a minimum, when needed.</p>

<p>Structured as a round robin, the tournament pitted 4-member teams against other 4-member teams from different schools. For one question, there was a  10-point tossup. If a team interrupts the tossup, they earn what is known as power, which elevates their possibility of getting 15 points for a question. However, the catch is the 5-point reduction for incorrect answers. After the tossup, there were three questions of bonus, each worth 10 points; each question was related to each other. Therefore, there were 45 maximum points. Conferring with teammates was not allowed.</p>

<p>Questions ranged from anything to everything: math, pop culture, literature, science, geography, music, and art. Alex Cohen once encountered a question about the painting, The Potato Eaters. He nonchalantly informed me that the artist was Van Gogh. A quick Google search confirmed his answer and his aptitude for Quiz Bowl. When asked how he studied, he casually explained, “Fact sheets, reading.” When asked the same question, Max Rosenberg revealed that he often quizzed himself with Quizlet, studying terms on war and geography.</p>

<p>Indeed, methods like these have proved successful. The BASIS Scottsdale team beat both Desert Vista, who usually dominates due to sheer number of contestants, and San Diego Olympian Science.</p>

<p>Max Rosenberg described the victory as exhilarating. “Our whole team was contributing. It was a lot of fun and it felt good…I had a few good powers at the end to seal the deal. When I buzzed in …it felt exciting especially as I answered and he confirmed.”</p>

<p>BASIS Scottsdale seized first in the lot: first as the varsity team and first as the novice team. “C” Team Captain Trey Connolly obtained first in the novice individual competition, and Alex Cohen obtained first in the varsity individual competition. However, when asked about his most memorable Quiz Bowl experience, Alex unassumingly replied, “when Mr. Witz opened a coke and it exploded everywhere.” When prompted for further elaboration, he explained. “He stood there for 2,456 years and then cleaned it up.”</p>

<p>Likewise, the BASIS Scottsdale Quiz Bowl team itself seems to have exploded onto the tournament scene over the past few years, cleaning up awards at competitions. Hopefully, the team’s upward trajectory will continue as they head to the National Quiz Bowl Championship.</p>
