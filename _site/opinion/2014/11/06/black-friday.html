<h2>Black Friday</h2>
<h4>By Gursajan Gill</h4>

<p>Two thousand people line the storefront as you, a Walmart employee, in a blue shirt, await the onslaught. Time until Walmart opens: 5 minutes. The crowd grows angry, impatient, and restless; they are starting to rattle the doors. All of a sudden, the door hinges give. The huge wave of people surges ahead. A stampeding mob of angry people seeking “the best deals of the year” confronts you. You see one of your colleagues fall over, trampled by the crowd. You try to move forward to help him, but you yourself are being pushed back. There is no one to help him.</p>

<p>This was the scene in a Long Island Walmart during Black Friday not too long ago. A crowd of 2,000 trampled and killed a 34-year-old Walmart employee, and when other employees tried to help, they were repelled. When the paramedics and police arrived, the crowd was still rowdy and violent. And for what? Simply to snag certain discounted items.</p>

<p>Black Friday is exemplifies how excessive consumerism and gluttony rule the U.S.A. Black Friday perfectly represents the hypocrisy of the American people. On the fourth Thursday of November, most Americans sit at home around a table, thanking each other for what they have and asking for nothing more. The very next day, Americans race to stores, push through lines, and fight over products, just so they can buy more stuff for less money. To score a deal, seven people have died, and 90 have been injured in the last eight years of Black Friday.</p>

<p>Black Friday, although it is a tradition, is merely another way for stores to make money. In fact, better deals than Black Friday occur during later times of the year. Many stores raise prices some months before Black Friday and dramatically cut the prices back to their original to give consumers an illusion of large discounts. A Wall Street Journal study even found out that many retailers work with their suppliers and set prices above the suggested retail price for most of the year and cut the prices back to the suggested retail price during Black Friday.</p>

<p>Black Friday is a complete waste of time, energy and money. Unfortunately, Black Friday symbolizes the modern American consumer mindset.</p>
