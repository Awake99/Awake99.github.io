<h2>Abundance of Stress and Its Antidote</h2>
<h4>By George Yang</h4>

<p>Lower School students are preparing for Precomps. Upper School students just finished Trimesters and see a new wave of tests. Veterans Day seems like the last gulp of breath before a long swim. We are reminded of the words of the Dory, an amnesic, but buoyant, Pacific Regal Blue Tang: “Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim~.” Nevertheless, stress often seems overwhelming; we believe that only someone who routinely forgets their past can move into the future with no worries.</p>

<p>Optimists point out the surplus of research showing how stress can be helpful. Richard Shelton of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Alabama, Birmingham notes that stress can boost memory, increase short-term immunity, and bring motivation. However, hopes fall when flu season commences and coughs and snivels become the norm, or (even worse) when we have a memory lapse during a test.</p>

<p>So, what’s the real story? According to Bruce McEwen, professor of Neuroendocrinology, stress causes animals to adjust. The creature secretes hormones and remembers where the stress occurred so it can escape the stress next time. It’s a natural learning aid.</p>

<p>The problem is that we cannot escape tests; a test is the Sword of Damocles, always dangling above our heads. Worse, chronic stress spurs anxiety, insecurity, and a deluge of other negative health effects, including blood vessel constriction and increased blood pressure. The symptoms mimic those of a bout of anger, explains Christopher Edwards of Duke University’s Medical Center: you often “experience lapses in judgment or logic.” That is too bad, especially when taking a math test.</p>

<p>The way to fix the problem is one that we already know and use—breaks. Not Summer or Thanksgiving Break, but routine breaks intended to relieve stress. Consider the following instructions a prescription to prevent the perils of stress.</p>

<p>1) How to power nap:
	Power napping must be strategic. You should tailor your napping lengths to your needs:
	10 to 20 minutes: use for a short boost in energy.
	30 minutes: use for catching up on sleep, not for energy. You feel tired for another thirty minutes after you wake up.
	60 minutes: good for memorizing information. Use this if you have finished studying and can afford around twenty minutes of grogginess when you wake up.
	90 minutes: this improves memory of both information and physical tasks. It is a full cycle of sleep, and allows you to wake up easily without any dazed feeling.
	Besides length, you can also make naps effective with coffee. If you have around twenty minutes, a cold cup of coffee nearby, and an exhausted mind, a caffeine nap may be the way to go. Sip the coffee, go to sleep, and the caffeine will make you wake up feeling invigorated.</p>

<p>2) How long to work: 90-minute rule.
	According to physiologist Nathaniel Kleitman, you should work in 90-minute cycles. He explains the symmetry between the dream life and the conscious life: in a 90-minute nap, we go through a full cycle of sleep, and in a 90-minute working period, we progress through the high and low levels of attentiveness.</p>

<p>3) How to break with focus.
	This is not an oxymoron. The most effective breaks are not the ones staring at a computer or TV screen, but rather the ones that are intentional. You should incorporate deep breathing and imagery, imagining that the test or assignment will turn out well. This mental break helps ease nervous tension. 
	Stress is inevitable at BASIS, but it’s helpful to have a few tools to deal with it. Richelle E. Goodrich puts it well: “You can add up your blessings or add up your troubles. Either way, you’ll find you have an abundance.”</p>
