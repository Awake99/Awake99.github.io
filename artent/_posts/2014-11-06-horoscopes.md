<h2>Horoscopes</h2>
<h4>By Molly Ono</h4>

<b> Libra </b> (September 23-October 22)

Stop posting selfies on Instagram! It is neither the time nor the place (and it never will be). 

Spirit Meme: Doge

<b> Scorpio </b> (October 23-November 21)

Enjoy the heat while it lasts. Your fragile body probably can’t handle another 70 winter. 

Spirit Meme: John Cena

<b>Sagittarius</b> (November 22-December 21)

You may think that you’re in love, but love can often be mistaken for indigestion, among other ailments. 

Spirit Meme: Blue black white gold

<b>Capricorn </b> (December 22-January 19)

Applying to college is a lot like learning to swim: either way, you’re going to drown.

Spirit Meme: Miley, what’s good? 

<b> Aquarius </b> (January 20-February 18)

Remember to set an alarm for the morning. And in class. And in the afternoon. You should probably stop falling asleep all of the time. 

Spirit Meme: They crave that mineral

<b> Pisces </b> (February 19-March 20)

A rolling stone gathers no moss. Actually, does anyone actually gather moss? Harvesting it doesn’t seem very profitable. 

Spirit Meme: The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

<b>Aries</b> (March 21-April 19)

You need to find yourself. 
Hopefully it’s not in a trashcan.

Spirit Meme: Psych! That’s the wrong number!

<b>Taurus</b> (April 20-May 20)

Um, quit procrastinating. You’re welcome. 

Spirit Meme: Who is she

<b>Gemini</b> (May 21-June 21)

You may or may not be forgetting to do something. Planners are helpful.

Spirit Meme: One does not simply

<b>Cancer </b> (June 22-July 22)

Love thy neighbor. Not too much though—that’s creepy.

Spirit Meme: *hacker voice* I’m in  

<b>Leo</b> (July 23-August 22)

This is the time to explore new things, new places, new people. Just remember, baby wipes are always helpful.

Spirit Meme: Rare Pepe

<b>Virgo</b> (August 23-September 22)

Treat yo’ self this month—you is kind, you is smart, you is important.

Spirit Meme: Bye Felicia
