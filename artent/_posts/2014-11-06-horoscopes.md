<h2>Horoscopes</h2>
<h4>By Molly Ono</h4>

Scorpio (October 24-November 22)

Fall is already in full swing—if you haven’t had your first pumpkin spice latte of the season, congratulations! If you’ve already had fifty, then you should probably consult a physician, because that’s probably not healthy. 

Sagittarius (November 23-December 21)

This is the month to try new things: with the changing of the leaves, roll over your own new leaf. Not that the cacti of Arizona change leaves or anything. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 20)

Visiting colleges soon? Be sure to be polite, smile, and ask plenty of questions. Oh, and just ignore the tension of the room with all of the other applicants and their uber-competitive parents. 

Aquarius (January 21-February 18)

Take this time to discover a new love in your life—a food that you might have always passed over, a person who you have never really considered. A facelift for your life can do wonders—without the dangerous complications of an actual facelift!

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You’re in that weird limbo of pumpkin: after the jack-o-lanterns of Halloween but before the pies of Thanksgiving. With all the sad and rotting pumpkins around, maybe do yourself a favor and opt for some decorative gourds—the warts on them are kind of cool. 

Aries (March 21-April 20)

Wisdom teeth are a pain. Hopefully, your parent isn’t cruel enough to tape you hopped up on pain meds, and then upload the footage to the Internet. 

Taurus (April 21-May 21)

So apparently Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” is not written about fellow songstress Katy Perry. Hurry, this is a divine sign to break up with your own frenemies before they too throw you under the public bus. 

Gemini (May 22-June 21)

Stop avoiding the problem and do the darn work—your future self will be getting plenty of sleep because of it. And—who are you kidding?—you need all the sleep you can get.  

Cancer (June 22-July 22)

Video games sucking all of your time away? League of Legends? Mortal Kombat? Even the beloved Smash Bros.? Just remember to spend time with loved ones: invite them to be pummeled by your almighty digital prowess every once in a while.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

This is the time for you to branch out and look for a job. More work, more cash, more experience, more cash…it’s basically a win-win.

Virgo (August 23-September 23)

College visits can be taxing, so visit the school’s cafeteria to refuel. If the food is crappy, then don’t go to that school. Like, don’t even consider it. 

Libra (September 24-October 23) 

Now is the time to revisit an interest you might have dropped a while ago: keeping a journal, break dancing, eating a diet of only Gushers. Reflect on the inner turmoil of your childhood to bring happiness to the present.
