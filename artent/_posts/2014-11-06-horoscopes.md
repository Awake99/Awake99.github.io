<h2>Horoscopes</h2>
<h4>By Molly Ono</h4>

<b>Virgo</b> (August 23-September 22)

Feeling stressed out already? Remember to keep long-term goals in mind, and be aware of when you may be burning out – you’re too special to be burnt to a crisp. 


<b>Libra </b>(September 23-October 22)

You’re probably not getting enough sleep. Like, come on. 


<b>Scorpio </b> (October 23-November 21)

Your love life is a little lacking right now, but only you can fix it. Or, you can just focus on grades, an easy substitute. 


<b>Sagittarius </b> (November 22-December 21)

You’re too preoccupied with the things to come. Remember to be in the now, or the now will eat you up like a Chipotle burrito bowl. 


<b>Capricorn </b> (December 23-January 19)

Don’t neglect your friends! Being alone can have awesome health benefits, but you really shouldn’t be alone with your own thoughts. 


<b>Aquarius </b> (January 20-February 18)

You should definitely try something new. A sport, maybe, or a type of food. Definitely food. This is an excuse to eat more food. 


<b>Pisces </b> (February 19-March 20)

This is the month that you quit procrastinating. Hopefully. Maybe. Heck, maybe do it next month. 


<b>Aries </b>(March 21-April 19)

You know, sometimes you can just get yourself into a little too much trouble. Formulate back-up plans and complicated excuses now to give your future self a break. 


<b>Taurus </b>(April 20-May 20)

Reach out to that person you kind-of know, but not really. They might just be the perfect match for your brand of weird. 


<b>Gemini </b> (May 21-June 21)

They say cleanliness is next to godliness. You should probably get on that. 


<b>Cancer </b>(June 22-July 22)

Chill. Chilllllllll. 


<b>Leo </b> (July 23-August 22)

A tall, dark, (possibly) handsome stranger will soon enter your life. Do not forget the baseball bat.
