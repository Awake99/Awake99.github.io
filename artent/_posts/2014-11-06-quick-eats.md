<h2>Quick Eats</h2>
<h4>By Eve Fabre</h4>

It might seem as if BASIS Scottsdale is a deserted, secluded building in some weird twilight zone between Desert Mountain High School and Fountain Hills, and, well, that isn’t completely wrong. But in case you ever forget a lunch and need somewhere to eat within a reasonable distance, here is a list to meet all your needs (time, cost, and quality) that – hopefully—will inspire your next meal. Browse the following categories of food options to plan your next outing. 

<b>The “Caffeine Fix”:</b>

It’s 7 a.m. and you need something to revitalize you after last night’s paltry three hours of sleep snuck in while writing the paper due today and studying for the day’s two tests. I got your back. These three coffee shops are all eight minutes away from BASIS Scottsdale and meet different tastes: Haggens’ Starbucks (caution: closes November 14th), Kona Coffee (a must) and Dunkin Donuts (a classic). While the first two have a limited range of breakfast foods, they have a wide variety of caffeine fixes. However, they are also the more expensive options. So if all you have is a dollar thirty five, then I suggest getting coffee from Dunkin Donuts—sometimes, cheaper is better.

Cost (coffee only): $

Quality: 8/10 (failing to score the last two points because they are not your cozy, sit-down coffee shops).

<b>The “30 minutes until lunch is over and I need something to munch on”:</b>

McDonald’s, Arby’s, Taco Bell, and Dairy Queen are all within an eight-minute one-way drive (using either Via Linda or Shea), and provide cheap but satisfying meals for just about any craving you might have. 

Cost: $-$$

Quality: 5/10

<b>The “My friends and I planned a lunch out”:</b>

You actually planned to go out with your friends for once. For the following “Quick-Eats,” allot a 30-minute round trip: Chipotle, AJs, Which Which, Chick-fil-A, and DJ’s Bagels. While these range in menu selections, they also differ in location. While DJ’s Bagels is in Fountain Hills, Chick-fil-a is at Shea and the 101, and the first three are all at the Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and Thompson Peak Parkway intersection. Smash Burger on Frank Lloyd Wright is also a great place for burgers, fries, and shakes and is only three minutes further than the trio on Thompson. 

Cost: $-$$

Quality: 9/10

<b>The “I don’t know if I’ll make it back in time, but I might as well try because it’s worth it”:</b>

Slightly higher in food quality than the last categories, these next three are a considerable 17- to 20-minute drive away from BASIS Scottsdale. Raisin’ Canes and Krispy Kreme sit on opposing corners (NE v. SW respectively) of the Scottsdale and Shea intersection, whereas In-N-Out Burger is closer to Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and Scottsdale Road (inside the Promenade Plaza). These wildly popular options are somewhat closer than you might have anticipated. 

Cost: $-$$

Quality: 10/10 (definitely would eat there again)
