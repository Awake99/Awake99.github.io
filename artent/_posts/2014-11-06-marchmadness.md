<h2>March Madness</h2>
<h4>By Raj Watson</h4>

With the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament approaching, March Madness is set to be one of the top sporting events across the country. Sixty-eight Division I colleges are selected by the 10 member NCAA selection committee, comprised of various athletic directors across all major and minor conferences.

Thirty-two teams receive an automatic entry into “The Big Dance” by capturing their own conference tournament; the remaining thirty-six are hand-picked by the committee to compete in the NCAA tournament as they have earned an at-large bid. The committee looks at a myriad of different factors to determine which teams can receive at-large bids. For example, the Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a team ranking system that takes into account more than just wins and losses. It measures the final score of a game, the tempo at which a team plays, the site or location where the game is played, and the strength of schedule of a team.

Usually the smaller schools make the tournament by winning their conference and bigger schools receive an at-large entry because of their notorious ability to make the tournament each year. However, many large schools can be “on the bubble” meaning that their hopes of making the tournament can be fulfilled or crushed at an instant.

The Journey to the Tourney began in 1939 and the three seed Oregon upset the two seed Ohio State in the championship (there were only eight teams in this tournament). From 1951 to 2000, the NCAA expanded the pool of collegiate teams from sixteen teams to sixty-four teams. Just recently in 2011, the NCAA expanded to sixty- eight teams with four play-in games to decide out of those four games, who will play each other in the first round of the Tournament. UCLA has the most NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championships at eleven as they won ten championships between the years 1964-1975 under legendary head coach John Wooden, which the Most Outstanding Player Award is named after. The Kentucky Wildcats come in at number two with eight championships (and North Carolina ties with Duke and Indiana for five championships.

During the course of this NCAA Basketball season, the number one team in the AP poll has changed six times, enlarging the field of potential winners and potential spoilers. Top twenty-five ranked teams have combined for more total losses than in any other season of college basketball. With that many losses among top twenty-five teams, this leaves the door wide open for small schools to knock off a top tier team. To pick your bracket for this year’s tournament, follow these three simple steps.

1. Always look for potential 5-12 seed and 6-11 seed upsets. These will be the major upsets of the tournament that everyone will be talking about.

2. Never pick a 1-16 upset. This has never happened in the history of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, although some 16 seeds have come close. Even though it may seem appealing to pick this large upset, avoid them at all costs.

3. Always pick from 1 seeds to 10 seeds in the Elite Eight. Only five teams greater than a ten seed have made it all the way to the Elite Eight. The top-tier teams usually sit in around the 1-4 seeds.
