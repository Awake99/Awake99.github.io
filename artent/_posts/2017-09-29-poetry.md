<h2>Poetry: Dead or Alive? </h2>
<h4>By Fajr Ahmad</h4>

Before you turn the page scoffing at the word “poetry,” think about how you would feel if someone rolled his or her eyes at your passionate speeches about video games, sports, makeup, calculus, or whatever it may be. Perception and subjectivity are part of everything in the world; poetry is no different. Students, especially at BASIS, are exposed to high and overwhelming levels of literature, poetry included, often spurring negative generalizations about the genre as a whole (shout-out to all the fifth graders who (tried to) read Beowulf). Here are some of your peers’ very honest thoughts: 

One bespectacled girl sitting in Latebird on a Thursday evening quickly responded with an “I don’t like it.” 

Another student complained, “Why do the whole stanza thing? There are so many ways to interpret one thing.” 

“It can be very useful in a very artistic way. I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it,” faculty member Ms. Smith said diplomatically. 

And my personal favorite: “Some poetry is good, but some is, like, meant for 2002...it was cool when Gilmore Girls was cool.”

On the flip side, many people pointed out the positive aspects of poetry and “the whole stanza thing.” 

“Poetry is a lot like fiction, but it doesn’t need as many words to fill; it’s a concise version of any other book with twice the effect,” a friend said. 

One looked into the specifics: “It’s really cool. Slam poetry--people get really into it; the poems have a deeper meaning or a message to convey, and it’s really interesting to see how people can take words and make them inspiring.” 

Many talked about poetry being “a creative way to express yourself” and “an important way to let out your emotions.” Another offered an interesting idea: “It can be really good, but it can be really bad. What if people relate to something so much that it makes them feel worse?" 

Personally, I’ve encountered too many people who have dismissed poetry, likely as some of you did after reading the title’s first word. I’ve noticed that as one’s maturity grows, so does the potential for poetic appreciation. Some, however, have told me that it’s outdated, irrelevant, even. I’m sure the growing wave of teenage Instagram poets and followers of people like Rupi Kaur and Lang Leav would beg to differ. No worries--in the same way that some don’t like the art of placing so much depth in so little words, some don’t like watching people throw around a almond-shaped ball or coming up with physics problems riddled with integrals and equations. Some boats are made of points or equations, but mine is made of words. Whatever floats yours, right?
