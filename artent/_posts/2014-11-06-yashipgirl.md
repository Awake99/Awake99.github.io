<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl: 

I recently tried out for the Varsity Basketball Team, but I didn’t even make Junior Varsity. For some reason, my skills did not translate to the court during tryouts, and other players overshadowed me. I am extremely disappointed because I thought I was good enough to make it since I play at lunch all the time. What should I do?

--TRIED AND FAILED 

Dear TRIED,

I know this will be tough to rebound from, but don’t get too down on yourself. I’m sure you would’ve been a steal. There are only 12 spots, and you may have just had an off day. If you care about basketball and want to improve for next year, then definitely talk to the coaches about what aspect of your game you should improve on. They’ll assist you. However, I will give you some coaching here on the basketball basics.

Firstly, passing is extremely overrated. If you are unsure about what to do, just throw the ball toward the basket—it’ll probably go in. To perfect the release of your shot, maximize horizontal movement, use both hands, and spread your arms out to the side as you follow through. Another basketball fundamental to keep in mind is to always trash-talk. Find something to insult about your opponent, and go on and on about it. Finally, just keep saying the word “ball” and its derivatives, like “baller” and “ballin’” (never pronounce the ‘g’). Eventually, people will think you are good. Hope this helps!

<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl:

I feel like my teacher is not preparing me for the AP Exam. He/she is fixated on one key figure in his/her class and repeatedly shows us documentaries on that person. Also, he/she tries to link all of his/her class to one theme. Somehow, he/she teaches for the entire class period, and I did not learn one thing pertinent to the AP. How can I fix this situation without offending anyone? 

--WORRIED about the AP 

Dear WORRIED, 

Even though I can understand your frustration, I think you might be blaming your teacher too early here. Each teacher offers his or her own perspective on a subject, allowing you to look at life through another perspective. Once you learn his/her vernacular in the class, you will learn to appreciate your teacher. You make have to work harder at home, but at the end of the year you will have a unique perspective on the subject.

However, if you are that worried, then your best strategy is to have a private meeting with the teacher and express your concern. Most teachers—if you tell them honestly but respectfully (e.g., don’t be as aggressive as Napoleon conquering Europe) how you feel—will want to improve their class. Their ultimate goal is for their students to succeed. Avoiding the problem until April may be the path of least resistance, but it is definitely not the best option. 

If your teacher refuses to change, then don’t make excuses. You have the power in your learning. Start preparing on your own for the AP. Get a prep book earlier than normal. Outline the chapters in a textbook. Look for interesting teachers who upload their lectures online. Don’t be afraid to be creative. Good luck!
