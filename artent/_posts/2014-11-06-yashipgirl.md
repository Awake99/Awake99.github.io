<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl: 

I'm a senior and I realized this week how much I miss BASIS now that I'm gone. There's nothing like waking up at 6 am and realizing that you do, in fact, have a trimester final today. I miss the smiling faces of the sweet little fifth- graders as they politely pass me in the hallways, the constant feel of adrenaline rushing through my body as I try in vain to complete that last problem on the test. I miss homework over breaks, quizzes on trimester week. But most of all, I miss you, Yash-ip girl, and the amazing advice you gave me on your column every month. Thanks bruh!

--SEÑOR Senior

Dear SEÑOR,

Yeah, although many sleep-deprived students find it hard to realize this, BASIS is a great place. The collection of faculty and students at BASIS is incredible, and the BASIS experience is entirely unique. But that does not mean that you cannot find experience what you enjoy about BASIS elsewhere.

While I urge you not to seek out any nine year-olds, try to meet up again with your BASIS friends. Chatting over lunch will make you feel like a student again. Plus, if you ever miss the school too much, spend some time catching up with your friends and teachers. The school’s not going anywhere (actually it is, but you get the idea).

Additionally, you have all the stress and anxiety of college to look forward to. You will have many forgotten tests and problems to race through.

Lastly, thank you for your support! I greatly enjoy providing advice to my readers, and it means a lot to hear them enjoy the advice. However, even if you no longer come to school every day, you can access the Gazette online at basisscottsdalegazette.com. The website is updated every month, so you can read the online version as if you were at school. The website even has a cool logo for this column, so check it out!

<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl:

Mock APs are coming up, and I am extremely upset about losing all of my Saturdays in April. I have an extremely active social life on top of my basketball training, so during April I have to choose between mock APs, parties, ball, and homework. How should I handle my time in April?

--STUDIOUS and athletic socialite

Dear STUDIOUS,

Wow, you are one busy person! I think the key for you is to establish your priorities and goals for the month. Once you establish these priorities, you can create a schedule for yourself depending on how hard you want to work and how much sleep you need.

Personally, I would value basketball training above all. It keeps you in shape and serves as a great stress reliever. Work on your jumper, handles, and defense. You’d probably still have time for either homework or parties after your mock APs. I would choose homework, just in case you don’t get that basketball scholarship from Duke. Savor the chance to do homework now, since if you play college athletics, someone else will probably do it for you.

If you choose this path, you’ll need to forget being a socialite since you won’t be attending any parties. Some of your friends might mock you for prioritizing school and basketball over socializing, but if you remember your goals, you should have no problem ignoring them. Hope this helps!
