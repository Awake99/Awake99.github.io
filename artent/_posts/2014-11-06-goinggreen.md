<h2>Going Green</h2>
<h4>By Trey Connelly</h4>

It’s that time of year again. The greenest day of the year is March 17th, and I’m not talking about Earth Day (April 22), Greenery Day (May 4 in Japan), or even the band Green Day (1986-present). I’m talking about Saint Patrick’s Day, or St. Patrick’s Day for short. Although it isn’t a federal holiday, it is a legal holiday in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and Savannah, Georgia. It is, however, celebrated widely across America and the world. Here are just a few things that will be green this year:

<i>The Chicago River</i>

On the Saturday before Saint Patrick’s Day, the Chicago River will be dyed bright green for several hours. The tradition started in 1962, when Stephen Bailey, a first-generation Irish-American and head of the city’s Saint Patrick’s Day parade, discovered that plumbers had been using green dye to discover where the city’s sewage system was leaking into the river. Each year since then, the Chicago Plumbers Local Union has had the duty of dyeing the water during the city’s parade.

<i>McDonald’s Milkshakes</i>

Perhaps the most anticipated menu item of the year behind the McRib, McDonald’s sells its seasonal Shamrock Shake every March in honor of the holiday. It was introduced in 1970 as a green-colored vanilla shake, but mint flavoring was added by 1983. However, it was only offered nationwide each March since 2012.

<i>The Empire State Building</i>

Construction of the (formerly) tallest building in the world began on March 17, 1930. That’s right—Saint Patrick’s Day. The date was decided by Al Smith, president of Empire State, Inc., four-time governor of New York, and second-generation Irish-American. Ever since 1976, the floodlights at the top of the building illuminating the spire have painted the New York City skyline green each Saint Patrick’s Day

<i>The Fountain Hills Fountain</i>

This one’s a local event! Each year the famous fountain in Fountain Park is dyed green to become the world’s tallest emerald fountain at noon. The dyeing is a part of the city’s Saint Patrick Day celebration, featuring traditional music and serving corned beef and cabbage all day long. Check it out afterschool on Thursday!
