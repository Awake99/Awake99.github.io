<h2>Yash-ip Girl</h2>


<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl: 

I feel that my friend and I are drifting apart this year. Now that we have different lunch periods, we never hang out, and I miss him/her greatly. What can I do to become close with him/her again?

--STRANDED in a Sea of Friendship </i>

Dear STRANDED:

Now, that’s some food for thought! Personally, my lunch consists of finishing homework and “balling,” rather than interacting with friends. Isn’t that what lunch is truly for? Face-to-face interactions are overrated, and your Lit annotations aren’t getting any better. Seclude yourself upstairs and focus on building your college app for your true Ivy League destiny. 

Of course, you could try a worse solution. Make new friends with people in your lunch period. Don’t worry about a lack of face-to-face time in our digital age. Connect with him/her over social media and make a conscientious effort to meet with him/her outside of school to study for a shared class or maybe even to relax at Scottsdale Fashion Square.

<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl:

When I walk up the stairs, I don’t know where to look. If I look straight ahead, I feel creepy. If I look up, I feel detached and run the risk of tripping. And of course, I cannot look down, since I am an alpha male.

--STAIRED and Afraid </i>

Dear STAIRED:

Even I don’t know where to stare going up the stairs. To paraphrase fellow columnist Trey Connelly, stairs have their ups and downs, especially when you use the stairs. 

I always walk up and down the staircase with a friend, so we can talk, avoiding the awkward scenario you described. Also, going with a friend can allow you to assert your dominance over him/her, achieving your alpha male desires. If you do chose to use this advice, make sure you walk carefully. That is, don’t trip. Though your well-being may be awarded some importance, falling downwards in the middle of the staircase would yield greater problems, specifically impeding the “flow.”

<i>Dear Yash-ip Girl, 
I’d like to submit a question to you and talk to you in person. If only I knew who you were...

I’m sorry to let you down, but for the purposes of this column, it is imperative that I maintain my identity a secret. It’s the only way I’ll be able to provide just, unbiased answers to your most pressing questions.
