<h2>Twisted Tongue Twisters</h2>
<h4>By Aria Narang</h4>

March, it is here! March is one of those months that have literally nothing going on. Valentine’s Day is in February, April fool’s Day is in April, and March is far from Christmas or anything else. However, March is a very pretty month in Arizona. The sun is always shining and there is cool weather. March is the month in which all Arizonans try to be outside all of the time to treasure the last few good months before it gets hot. But the outside is boring, so I am going to attempt in making it fun for you. Have you guys every heard of tongue twisters? Assuming you have, I am going to give you a few of my favorites to see if you are a pro like me.

<i>The big, black bug bit the little, blue bug, but the little, blue bug bit the big, black bug back.</i>

Wasn’t that one so hard?! The best way to master these is to say it really slow first. Try to articulate each sound very slowly first, and then see if you can do it faster and faster until you are as good as me (I am really not that good, but just play along). Even though I have only given you one tongue twister so far, I hope you have noticed that the theme for these tongue twisters is March and springtime. That way you have something fun to do in March that will not make you look totally insane (FYI: Saying these out loud will result in severe embarrassment). Alright, let’s see if you can do this one.

<i>Betty bought some butter, but the butter Betty bought was bitter, so Betty bought some better butter, and the better butter Betty bought was better than the bitter butter Betty bought before!</i>

I realize that this one could be for any month, but cut me some slack! Anyways, did you like this one? Assuming you are like me when it comes to tongue twisters, you probably though it was so easy until you mixed up butter and better about five times, and then finally realized it was hard. It is ok, I am here for you. Alright guys I have one last one for you.

<i>Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?</i>

Yes, I know this one is extremely popular, but I decided to put it on here just for fun.

Hopefully, you guys have enjoyed these, and at least have conquered one of them. Now, next time you see your grandmother or your baby cousin who still can’t sound out her Rs, you can give them these tongue twisters and see if they can do them better than you (if they can, you should put it on YouTube because no one would believe you).
