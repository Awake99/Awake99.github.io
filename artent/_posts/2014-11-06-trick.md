<h2>Trick, Not Treat</h2>
<h4>By Bailey Mirmelli</h4>

Trick-or-Treating is great, but once weird looks and questions about your age become inevitable, you know it’s time to retire the pillowcase and pick up the candy bowl. Whether you are planning to hand out candy or throw a bowl out on the door mat lazily with the ever-ignored “Take One, PLEASE” sign, children are counting on you not to ruin their trick-or-treating experience. You’ve been there. But while you know you don’t have to give out the valuable full-sized bars (I get it -- you’d much rather keep them), you should never, EVER even consider handing out these candies.
<ul>
<li>Flavored Licorice: Whether the flavor is orange or caramel or root beer, it will always taste the same -- like a failed chemistry kid’s experiment.</li>
<li>Circus Peanuts: It looks like a peanut, tastes like a banana?</li>
<li>Necco Wafers: No one asked for an antacid.</li>
<li>Mary Jane Candies: Your jaw will feel like it ran a
marathon, and your taste buds will feel like they’ve just lost Fear Factor.</li>
<li>Sweethearts: Wrong holiday.</li>
<li>Dubble Bubble: It’s like chewing on solid Pepto-Bismol.</li>
<li>Sugar Daddies: They attract nothing but molars.</li>
<li>Jawbreakers: Why not just suck on a rock?</li>
<li>Strawberry Candies: Why don’t you just hand out a bunch of Halls instead? At least you’d be helping a poor kid’s throat.</li>
<li>Laffy Taffy: You can never eat them without also eating half its wrapper.</li>
<li>Almond Joy: Just give him a real chocolate bar. If he wanted an entire almond, he probably would’ve asked.</li>
<li>Good and Plenty: We are good and plenty without them.</li>
<li>Raisins: Enough said.</li>
<li>Toothbrushes: You’re too late.</li>
</ul>
