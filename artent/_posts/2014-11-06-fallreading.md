<h2>Fall Reading</h2>
<h4>By Anirudh Julakanti</h4>

It’s that time of the year again! Halloween approaches. People are going out to buy new costumes; others are going to get new decorations, take out old ones, or make their own. But what is the best part of the month? The candy. But what makes Halloween truly an amazing holiday is those horrifying stories, the ones that rattle you down to the bone. Others may prefer the Harry Potter series, which has released a new book. Here are a few good books to read or reread for this month!

For those who like the spooky stories, one you should definitely read is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, and yes, that is the title. It is a collection of short stories put into three books, and it’s a great way to scare some people. It is a great combination of folklores and urban legends. But, in my opinion, the short stories of the first book are the best because they combine fear and a little comedy, sprinkled with some despair. It is truly a great way to celebrate Halloween if you read this book.

For those who aren’t into those types of books, you are better off reading or rereading the Harry Potter series, because who doesn’t like Harry Potter right? The chosen one and all that? Well, these books are a great way to pass the time, and they are amazing to read even if you have read them ten times already. These books, if you read them or not, are great because J.K. Rowling combines the secret life of wizards and witches into the normal and everyday life of regular humans!
