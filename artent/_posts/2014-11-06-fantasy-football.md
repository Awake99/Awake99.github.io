<h2>Prize and Punishment</h2>
<h4>By Gursajan Gill</h4>

The time of year has arrived once again. The nation’s attention turns to football, an all-American sport watched and enjoyed by millions. A part of the American culture, football launched the time-honored tradition of tailgating and the increasingly popular trend of fantasy football. Since kickoff day, football fans have been constantly raving, checking stats, following games, and monitoring the waiver wire. Now, fantasy football reigns as one of the most popular online competitions in America. 

Fantasy football leagues range from casual to serious. In many of the serious leagues, competition can grow very intense, heightened by the unpredictable nature of the NFL season. Many of these leagues have prizes for the winners, but there are a few leagues which, rather than prizes, have punishments.

The following is a list of five punishments that have transpired in fantasy football leagues. Hopefully, these ideas can inspire you to come up with other creative methods of punishment for torturing the owner of the worst team in your league: 

5. The Renaming

Very easy to enforce, renaming remains quite popular in many fantasy football leagues. This simple punishment gives the winner of the football league the luxury to rename the worst team in the football league for the next season. This often results in many humiliating fantasy team names. 

4. The Hijack

This punishment is quite cruel in terms of fantasy football. Here, the loser must accept a trade from the winner for the next fantasy football season. This trade involves only one player and usually exchanges the loser’s best player for the winner’s worst player. Though it may seem like this dooms the loser to another terrible fantasy football season, the unpredictable nature of fantasy football often renders this untrue. 

3. The Servant(s)

The Servant is a classic. The loser has to follow around the winner and do the winner’s bidding. This often takes place over a given period of time and sometimes also can be expanded to where the bottom half of the losing teams has to serve the top half, with the winner getting the first pick out of the loser. Some leagues even go as far as forcing the “servant” to pay for various foods and drinks. 

2. The Roulette

The Roulette does not just punish the worst team, it punishes every team that did not win. First, the winner writes down a list of punishments of varying degrees of intensity and pain. Then, the teams get to choose their punishment, but in a particular order. The second-place team chooses first, the third-place team chooses second and so on, until the last place team chooses. The last place team often ends up with the worst, funniest, and most embarrassing punishment. 

1. The Public Shaming

Everyone’s favorite is the public shaming. The punishment can range from standing next to highway holding a sign and wearing embarrassing clothes to being pelted with tomatoes. Some have taken it so far that the losers must get permanent tattoos. Have fun, be creative, but don’t do anything dangerous or illegal.
