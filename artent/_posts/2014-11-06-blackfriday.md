<h2>Black Friday</h2>
<h4>By Trey Connelly</h4>

Today, Black Friday refers most commonly to the day after Thanksgiving and the start of the Christmas shopping season. However, Black Friday has named many different events throughout history for many different reasons.

The name for the shopping holiday originates from an accounting tradition. When recording ledgers, losses were marked in red ink and gains in black ink. Thus, a financially insolvent business is called “in the red” and a solvent one “in the black.” Retailers make most of their profits at the end of year in the Christmas shopping season, so the day marked when they would begin to be in the black.

The name Black Friday has been used in different contexts for almost two thousand years. Good Friday, the Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, is also known by that darker name. The black refers to the color of vestments (religious clothing) worn by clergy on the day to represent their mourning of Jesus’s death.

The color black in western culture is also associated with darkness and evil. Black cats, especially, are known as familiars of witches that bring bad luck. This association brought about the alternate title of Black Friday for Friday the 13th, the superstitious day of bad luck.

Black Friday has also been the name of several financial crises. The first was in 1869, when speculators James Fisk and Jay Gould attempted to convince President Ulysses S. Grant limit the U.S. government’s sale of gold so that they could corner the gold market. When Grant eventually realized what they were doing, he ordered the Treasury Department to rapidly sell gold, causing plummeting stock prices and months of economic disruption.

Just four years later the Panic of 1873, caused by the crash of the Vienna Stock Exchange, led to years of economic depression around the world, also earning it the title Black Friday. It’s not all history though; this June, the financial markets experienced another Black Friday the day after the United Kingdom voted in support of exiting the European Union. The result was the largest single-day drop ever as investors lost over two trillion USD.

This Thanksgiving, while you’re camping out overnight to be first in line for when stores open, take some time to remember the history of Black Fridays and consider shopping on Cyber Monday instead.
