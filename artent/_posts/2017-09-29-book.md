<h2>Book Review: The Alchemist </h2>
<h4>By Katelyn Cai</h4>
Published in 1988, The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is an allegorical masterpiece about a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who abandons everything he has known to follow his wild dream of finding treasure in Egypt. It is simple in diction and good for all ages, but explores more powerful and meaningful ideas about faith, perseverance, and following one’s heart. 

Santiago, who is content to live in the Andalusian wilds with his sheep, is persuaded by a gypsy dream-teller and an old man claiming to be a king to sell his sheep and go to Egypt to find his foretold treasure. First, he goes to Tangier, where a thief steals his money, forcing the boy to work at a crystal shop where he learns to read the omens. Then, he moves to a desert caravan, where he meets a most interesting Englishman, whose relentless search for the mysterious 200-year-old alchemist inspires Santiago to take up his quest for his treasure once more. At the oasis, Santiago is exposed to the greatest alchemy of all—love—and he believes he has found his treasure. But, with the help of the alchemist, he completes the last leg of his journey, full of dangers and discoveries, and finds his treasure where he least expects. 

This story is simple yet exotic, full of the greatest lessons any person can hold dear. Courage, hope, free spirit, struggle—all leads up to the fulfillment of the Personal Legend, which is the calling of the soul. 

For those who can pick up a good book and read between the lines to find significant, deeper meanings, this book is sure to satisfy.
