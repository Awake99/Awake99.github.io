<h2>Giving Thanks to Big Business</h2>
<h4>By Aria Narang and Bobby Yalam</h4>

How did Thanksgiving, one of the most honorable American holidays, transform into one of the most crucial money-makers for commercial industry? Initially meant to celebrate the relations between the Native Americans and the European pilgrims, Thanksgiving has lost its traditional value to the dominance of big business.

Four-hundred years ago, the pilgrims and Native Americans set aside their ethnic differences and celebrated the unity of their cultures. Gradually, as industrialization has progressed and money has become more of a priority, Thanksgiving no longer emphasizes the initial feeling of connectedness and family. While the feast has always been a feature of this holiday, the introduction of Black Friday in the mid-1900s demeaned the significance of family, sparking the overbearing focus on materialistic desires. The massive sales on Black Friday overshadow the important cultural festivities of
Thanksgiving, turning the mood into one driven by social and financial goals. One example of such inappropriate behaviors is when families avoid spending valuable time with each other during Thanksgiving dinner and instead wait to be the first customer at major stores the following day, sacrificing the chance to strengthen emotional connections between loved ones.

While material possessions provide temporary enjoyment, they pale in comparison to the withstanding memories that could be made sharing a meal with their closest friends and families. Businesses profit by exploiting the fading emotional basis of Thanksgiving, manipulating buyers’ material priorities to sell their products. The contrast between human desire 400 years ago and that of the present materialistic hunger will forever haunt the true emotional impact of Thanksgiving, providing a reason to reflect on one’s holiday decisions concerning family relations.
