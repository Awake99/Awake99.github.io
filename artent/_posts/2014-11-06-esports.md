<h2>E-Sports Satire</h2>
<h4>By Eve Fabre</h4>

Oh, How Time Flies

From League, to Dota, to CS Go, 
It all looks like a puppet show,
hours and hours wasted
bet your face will look pallid,
3 a.m. and an essay to go.  	
What My Mom Has To Say 
Why is this a sport?
Go outside and enjoy nature
It's been two whole days!
