<h2><i>Blurryface</i> - Twenty One Pilots</h2>
<h4>By Jayden Soni</h4>

After bursting onto the scene with their official debut record, Vessel, Twenty One Pilots enjoyed even more success with the release of their sophomore effort last May. Blurryface debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard charts, no small feat for the unique duo from Cleveland, Ohio. 

Regardless of one’s preferred genre, all 14 tracks are worth a listen. Known for their emotional studio recordings and electrifying live sets, the band put out what was an expected continuation of their previous work with a few surprises that have further expanded their fan base.

From the first moments of the opening track, “Heavydirtysoul,” the positive growth is clear. Opening with electronic static, the track features fast-paced drumming, powerful vocals, and an overall bigger sound. They stay true to their roots, however, when it comes to Tyler Joseph’s thoughtful lyrics, a huge element of the band’s appeal.

Musically, there’s a little bit of everything. Both “The Judge” and “We Don’t Believe What’s on TV” feature the ukulele, which was employed on Vessel as well. The electronics used heavily in “Doubt” and “Polarize” sound fuller, and drummer Josh Dun kicks things up a notch with fast and interesting rhythms in “Lane Boy” and “Message Man.”

The band branches out completely on “Ride,” which features a reggae sound, with offbeat synth and heavy bass. Also new is Dun’s trumpeting, highlighted on a couple of the songs, but Joseph’s piano, which serves as the foundation of “Hometown,” brings long-time listeners back to the beginning.

As far as lyrics go, there is more variety. Ranging from the playful “I’m driving, here I sit, cursing my government for not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement” in “Tear in My Heart” to the more serious “Who would you live for? Who would you die for? And would you ever kill?” in “Ride,” each phrase seems carefully crafted to convey or provoke as much thought as possible.

Fans of wordplay and symbolism will not be disappointed. Within the songs, there are phrases like “Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter” in “Stressed Out.” 

Then of course, the album as a whole is based around the character of Blurryface, who Joseph describes as a manifestation of his fears and insecurities. He goes so far as to paint his neck and hands black in music videos, to represent a resulting restriction of both speech and action.

The story begins with songs like “Fairly Local,” where Blurryface appears in the form of a low pitch-shift effect on Joseph’s voice. It then ends with tracks like “Not Today,” which features lyrics that continue to question, but ultimately voice self-confidence.

The record’s final song, “Goner” provides perhaps the most interesting story on the album. Its first two minutes were written three years ago on an old accordion, which produced an ominous noose-like creak, disturbing given the depressing lyrics.

The song was left off of Vessel, but it was chosen to serve as the finale of of Blurryface. In doing so, Joseph and Dun added another two minutes to the song, ending both the album and song with what appears to be part continued struggle and part triumphant defeat of Blurryface himself.

I could write more, but I do not have the space, desire, or knowledge to reveal all the record has to offer. All that keeps this from being a five-star album is that I see no sense in limiting what these two can continue to produce. The future looks bright, with much more to come.

Rating: 4.5 stars
