<h2>Five Hidden Gems</h2>
<h4>By Jayden Soni</h4>

This month, rather than do an in-depth review of a single new album, I decided to look at the overlooked work of five well-known artists. Whether they are precursors to mainstream success, forgotten, or simply underrated, these albums are all worth a listen.

Brand New Eyes – Paramore

Falling between their breakout album Riot and recent self-titled album that brought even more fame, Paramore’s Brand New Eyes is too often forgotten as arguably the bands most intricate and yet cohesive record. Standout singles “The Only Exception” and “Ignorance” are some of the bands most famous songs, but the album as a whole does not get as much respect as it deserves.

From Josh Farro’s standout guitar riffs to his brother Zac’s unique drumming style to Hayley Williams’ powerful yet controlled voice, every moment is filled with multiple places to listen. The band combines a sonic and emotional maturity not present on Riot with the versatility of a five-piece band that their self-titled lacks, following the Farro brothers’ exit.

Rating: 4.5 stars

Check out: “Feeling Sorry,” “Turn it Off”

Humbug – The Arctic Monkeys

When AM was released in 2013, The Arctic monkeys were showered with unprecedented levels of fame and exposure. Their earlier music, however, is too often neglected. Albums like Humbug may not have the same distinctive riffs and catchy melodies of AM, but they are certainly not far off.

In this album, the band employs powerful intros on multiple occasions, including the first two songs: “My Propeller” and “Crying Lightning.” Also notable is their willingness to throw in unexpected rhythms and chords, as well as instrumental breaks and electronic sounds with greater frequency.

Rating: 4 stars

Check out: “Secret Door,” “Pretty Visitors”

We are Born – Sia

Sia blew up with her latest album 1000 Forms of Fear, led by standout tracks “Chandelier” and “Elastic Heart.” Less well known, however, are the multiple albums that came before it, dating back to 1997. Sia’s second most recent work is We are Born, a more experimental album than her latest one.

In addition to her pop sound, it features more jazzy songs like “Be Good to Me,” as well as guitar-based tracks like “Big Girl Little Girl.” The lyrical content is also interesting,  Sia’s distinctive voice is still the focus of the record, and just as powerful as ever.

Showbiz – Muse

Before reaching worldwide fames with albums like The Resistance and The 2nd Law, Muse came out with their first album way back in 1999. The instrumentation is somewhat simpler than their more recent work, and Matthew Bellamy’s vocals aren’t quite as powerful, but piano-driven “Sunburn” falls right in live with some of the band’s best work.

“Muscle Museum” follows with a tantalizing guitar intro and strong bassline, and a mix of loud, strong vocals and smooth falsetto. Like We are Born, the album is somewhat experimental and not as cohesive as future work, but it has some gems and it’s at the very least fun to see where the band began.

Rating: 3.5 stars

Check out: “Sober,” “Cave”

It Won’t Be Soon Before Long - Maroon 5

Lumped between Songs About Jane and Hands All Over, the album that features hit singles “Makes Me Wonder,” “Wake Up Call,” and “Won’t Go Home Without You” has had a fate similar to that of Paramore’s Brand New Eyes. Its other songs are too often forgotten.

The record is smooth all the way through, from the bouncy guitar riffs of “If I Never See Your Face Again” and “Can’t Stop” to the heartfelt piano and strings of “Back at Your Door,” the album’s closing ballad. The band showcases definite jazz and rock influences, but drifting in a much more pop direction, resulting in an interesting fusion.
