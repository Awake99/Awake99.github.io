<h2>Apple’s iPhone 6S Success</h2>
<h4>By Jayati Sharma</h4>

From the back pocket of our jeans to the front row of the movie theatre, they have practically taken over our most inter-connected world. From snapping the most poised selfie to creating new soundtracks, they have infiltrated nearly every aspect of our lives, and show no signs of stopping soon. And the iPhone, perhaps the biggest deal of the smartphone generation, continues to parade new features every year. 

On Wednesday, September 9, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company’s latest line of shiny, new products, among which were the iPad Pro, new Apple TV, iWatch OS 2, and, of course, the coveted new iPhone 6S. 

Labeled as the “most popular” smartphone to have vibrated on the planet, the iPhone (even with its size adjustments and operating system transformations) seldom disappoints. Though released in an all-new rose gold color, the newest model, largely consistent in size when compared to its iPhone 6 counterpart, exhibits more software than hardware improvements. 

The new iPhone boasts 3D touch, an innovative technology that allows users to leverage finger pressure on the phone screen in systematic commands. A light push on the screen enables the “Peek” feature, whereby one views a preview screen for a picture, text, email, webpage, social media post, etc. Pressing the screen only slightly harder, the “Pop” feature is enabled, taking users to the full screen view of the selected material. With the ability to detect the slightest changes in distance between the cover glass and the phone’s backlight, 3D touch provides an innovative way to increase efficiency on the iPhone. Though the capacitive pressure sensors add weight to the model, the extra clicks and swipes that 3D touch saves us may just be worth it. 

Users can also shoot video in 4K, a resolution four times that of 1080p HD. The phone’s 12-megapixel iSight camera prides itself on being able to take the clearest, sharpest, fullest pictures yet. 

Also featured is the fun, new Live Photos functionality that turns captured photos into small videos, kind of contextualizing the moment in time. With the feature turned on, users can press a picture to reveal the movements both immediately before and after the photo was taken. 

Though the latest model does not feature any particular groundbreaking changes, such as those seen in the iPhone 5 or 6, its subtleties enhance the inherent simplicity Apple strives to breathe through all its products, making the 6s a success.
