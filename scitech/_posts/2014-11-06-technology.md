<h2>The Cure to a Technological Epidemic</h2>
<h4>By Divya Vatsa</h4>

Bam! My heart slams against my ribs as my precious phone slams against the harsh, unforgiving ground. In some strange way, time itself seems to stop. And yet I cannot seem to move in time to rescue my phone from its tragic demise. Now, every time I look at my screen, those delicate cracks glare back at me, and I am overcome with that same sense of defeat yet again.

Just yesterday, it seemed as though I would have to live with those cracks until my next iPhone upgrade. But it seems as if the world of science has taken pity on us clumsy phone users. This past year, French materials scientist Ludwik Leibler from the ECSPI Institute in Paris has created a new class of plastics called vitrimers or self-healing plastics. Earning him the European Patent Office’s 2015 Inventor Award, Leibler’s research pioneers a future for everlasting plastics. 

So what is the science behind this new technology? Leibler first decided to embark on this research after being inspired by T-1000 in Transformers 2. He began to study two existing families of plastics: thermoplastics and thermosets. The former has properties that allow it to change shape when heated. However, the limitations are that once cooled, its new shape become permanent. Thermosets, on the other hand, are unique in that their shape cannot be changed in heat. 

Using this contrast as his foundation, Leibler set out to combine certain properties of each family while adding his own features. Leibler was able to capture the qualities of the plastics to be reheated and reshaped an infinite number of times. Then he added other important properties, such as durability and dimensional stability. The result? Leibler’s vitrimers.

When asked about the potential of vitrimers, the French scientist shared the endless possibilities and predicted a very bright future. He aims to release this new product to cars, planes, and other gadgets that are susceptible to damage and cracks. And while it will be a few years before we get to see this revolutionary technology in the market, I am looking forward to a future where my anxiety will not be due to dropping my phone.
