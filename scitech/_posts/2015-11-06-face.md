<h2>Hurricane Harvey: A Product of Climate Change?</h2>
<h4>By Vilina Mehta</h4>

Apple’s recent introduction of the iPhone X and its Face ID feature, a recognition software that creates precise facial depth maps, has sparked much discussion about facial recognition’s future. 

While it may seem new for us Americans, China actually has already implemented facial recognition in various sectors of society: catching criminals, verifying drivers’ identities, and even paying restaurant bills. Many anticipate the technology’s prevalence in the United States, as well. Potentially, it could serve as a substitute for passwords, PINs, and other proofs of identity, including credit cards or passes to exclusive venues. Facial recognition may also benefit law enforcement. For instance, snapshots of people’s faces may be used to catch and identify criminals. 

However, these applications raise numerous questions concerning privacy, especially as the technology becomes more sophisticated. If law enforcement does implement facial recognition technology in the future, they could monitor people and store pictures of suspects’ profiles. Also, corporations could use such technology to identify emotions based on facial cues for feedback to tailor future advertisements towards their customers or for assessment of their workers’ satisfaction with their jobs. The problem with both of these approaches is that the facial recognition machines might extract people’s information without their consent. For this reason, government regulation will be necessary to ensure that facial recognition technology is a beneficial tool instead of an intrusive technology used for malicious or selfish purposes. 

Facial recognition technology, despite the concerns surrounding it, will likely become a facet of everyday life as common and as accepted as voice recognition technologies like Siri and Echo, medical technologies like implantables, and wearable technologies like the Fitbit.
