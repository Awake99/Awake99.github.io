<h2>What's in a Name?</h2>
<h4>By Shrey Gupta</h4>

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but an iWatch by any other name would make headlines. Last month marked a departure from the usual naming trends of Apple and Microsoft, tech titans who recently revealed the  Apple Watch and Windows 10, respectively. 

Why is the Apple Watch not an iWatch?

●	The iSwatch theory: The renowned Swiss watchmaker Swatch recently released the iSwatch, an LCD based digital watch, and immediately threatened to sue Apple over the use of the term “iWatch.” In order to avoid a costly and unnecessary legal battle, Apple switched the name to Apple Watch. (But, then again, Apple has not previously backed down from prior trademark lawsuits. Case in point: Apple using the previously Cisco-owned trademark “iPhone”)

●	The Post-Jobs Theory: The “i” prefix was reminiscent of the Steve Jobs era of personalized computing, starting with the iMac and quickly spreading to iPod, iPhone, iLife, etc. The Apple Watch is the first completely new device launched under Tim Cook’s leadership, and the departure from Jobs’ “i” may mark Cook’s attempt to push Apple into a new era of greater corporate presence.

Why is Windows 10 not Windows 9?

●	The “So Much Innovation” Theory: According to Microsoft, Windows 10 brings an unparalleled level of innovation (even though it looks just like Windows 7, with some live tiles trapped in the Start Menu). Such a groundbreaking operating system surely deserves to skip a version number, no? Microsoft explains, in its best diplomatic language: “Windows 10 carries Windows forward into a new way of doing things. It is not an incremental change, but a new Windows that will empower the next billion users.”

●	The Lazy Coder Theory: This theory seems much more practical than the first. Typically, application developers write specific portions of code to maintain compatibility with certain operating systems. For example, an application designed for Windows XP may have some compatibility code to run on legacy systems, like Windows 98. It turns out that many of these coders were extremely lazy, writing code like this:
	
	if (version.StartsWith("Windows 9")) {/* 95 and 98 */}. 
	
In other words, they assumed that all versions of Windows beginning with “Windows 9” would refer to either 95 or 98...unless, of course, there’s actually a “Windows 9.” Considering that many of the applications written for Windows still retain this legacy code, it would have been a nightmare to name the newest version of Windows as “Windows 9.”
