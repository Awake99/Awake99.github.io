<h2>More Than Moore's Law</h2>
<h4>By Eric Ye</h4>

Do you think that electronics just aren’t thin enough? Well, they’re about to get thinner and more powerful. Recently, at UC Berkeley, scientists have created the smallest transistors yet, measuring one nanometer thick. A transistor is the most basic unit of computing hardware; processors and other electronic chips that make computers work are made up of billions.

Conventional thinking has dictated that the size of a transistor is limited to around five nanometers. Berkeley scientists have broken through this limit. Typical transistors are created with silicon, a cheap and reliable material. The difference between these new one nanometer transistors and silicon transistors is that they use molybdenum disulfide and carbon nanotubes for a more compact design.

The current industry standard for silicon transistors is fourteen nanometers. According to Moore’s Law, the number of transistors in integrated circuit design would double every two years. Naturally, his law is just a prediction, but the semiconductor industry has chosen Moore’s Law as a target for developing new semiconductors. However, because transistors are too large, the industry is gradually deviating from Moore’s Law as they are running out of space to put the transistors. The recent breakthrough by Berkeley scientists promises a future of smaller and smaller transistors and thus smaller and more powerful chips.
