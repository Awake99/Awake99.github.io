<h2>Scientists Spy on a Cell's Secret Life</h2>
<h4>By Malavika Krishnan</h4>

Just as we have memories and experiences that define who we are, each cell in our body has an intriguing past filled with interactions with other cells, molecules, and potential invaders. Imagine how insightful it would be to record the memories of an individual cell’s life in order to grasp a better understanding of cellular behavior. 
	
That is exactly what Timothy Lu and the rest of his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wished to accomplish.  The scientists created a model of an ideal memory system, known as Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events, or SCRIBE for short. The program alters a cell’s DNA so that when a cell responds to a signal, the information received will not be removed from the genetic material. The length of this DNA mutation is determined by the duration of the signal--for example, a short signal will only show a small amount of altered DNA sequence, whereas a longer signal will have a greater effect on the alteration of DNA. The different, altered DNA is expressed through the use of retrons, which produce the altered DNA when the cell is exposed to some sort of signal. 

Lu and his team performed several experiments to test the scope of SCRIBE and the different interactions it is capable of capturing. For example, Lu inserted an antibiotic resistance gene in some cells in response to light. When he looked back at the alterations of DNA, he was able to clearly see which cells received the antibiotic and which did not based simply on their responses to light. In another experiment, Lu left these living cells submerged in water for a week and then examined the alterations in their DNA. As a result, he was able to see all the interactions the cells experienced in the water, as well as the different bacteria the cells were exposed to.   

Because SCRIBE provides an indication of the myriad of different interactions that a cell undergoes daily, the program allows scientists to determine how one cell develops differently in comparison to another cell. Lu and the rest of the scientific community are incredibly excited about this latest development and its potential to affect our understanding of cells in the future.
