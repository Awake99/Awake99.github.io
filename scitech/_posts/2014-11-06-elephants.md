excerpt: "It has become a popular notion that Mars may potentially serve as a home for mankind in the future. NASA has sent probes and robots to the Red Planet to determine if it can sustain life. This pursuit has been driven largely by the search for water."

<h2>Envying Elephants</h2>
<h4>By Nitya Aggarwal</h4>

Cancer affects about one in four humans, making it a problem scientists are desperate to solve. But for elephants, cancer is not much of an issue. Elephants possess an effective means of protecting themselves against cancer, an ability researchers wanted to understand.

Essentially, animals grow through cell division. Large animals, like elephants, grow much more than small animals, like mice. Therefore, a smaller animal experiences less cell division than a bigger animal. 

Cancer, on the other hand, is caused by uncontrollable cell division. Consequently, animals like elephants must contract cancer more often than smaller animals, like mice or humans, merely because the chances of uncontrollable cell division are higher. 

But, in a phenomenon called Petoâ€™s Paradox, only one in twenty elephants contract cancer, and mice get cancer just as often as humans. In addition, Dr. Joshua Schiffman of the University of Utah discovered that all baby elephants should be dying of colon cancer at the age of three because of the high risk of cancer. Since elephants live past the age of three, several scientists have speculated that large animals with long life spans must have evolved cancer-fighting mechanisms or they would be extinct.

To investigate this attribute, scientists looked at one particular gene called p53. The protein encoded by this gene basically overlooks cellular division. In some cases, p53 keeps cells from dividing more; in other cases, p53 even makes faulty cells commit suicide. 

Humans only have one pair of this gene, or two copies. Elephants, scientists learned, have 20 pairs, or 40 copies. 

For the purpose of testing the effectiveness of extra copies of p53, researchers bombarded elephant cells with things known to cause cancer, including radiation and ultraviolet rays. In each case, the affected elephant cells killed themselves instead of trying to repair the damage, an efficient and effective way of blocking cancer. 

P53 proved itself very useful to elephants, making researches hopeful for a possible cure. However, experiments found that while p53 prevents cancer in elephants, mice given extra amounts of p53 also aged faster, which is not exactly a minor side effect. While scientists are sure to experiment with p53, a cure for cancer still dangles out of the reach of scientists.
