<h2>Election Update</h2>
<h4>By Nichole Kyprianou</h4>

After Clinton came out from two national conventions with a clear lead, recent polls show the gap between Trump and Clinton tightening. In early August, Clinton led Trump by five points and in early September, Clinton led Trump by eight points among likely voters. Now, Clinton is in the lead by around five points, still a sizeable margin. Clinton and Trump’s presidential race seems to be defined by education, gender, and race. According to the Washington Post, Trump leads Clinton in support from men without college degrees. Fifty-four percent of women support Clinton, while fifty-five percent of men support Trump. Fifty-three percent of white voters support Trump, while sixty-nine percent of non-white voters support Clinton. According to recent polls, both candidates seem to be negatively viewed by voters with fifty-seven percent of registered voters viewing both Clinton and Trump unfavorably.

Seeing how both candidates are viewed as dishonest by the public and Trump is closing in on Clinton’s lead, it seems that no one will win this election by a double-digit percentage. The last president to have won by a landslide is Ronald Reagan, who led Mondale by 18 points. In the past, party identification had more to do with family traditions and regional ties instead of ideology, according to Jonathan Darman, author of Landslide: LBJ and Ronald Reagan at the Dawn of a New America. Because of this mentality, it was conceivable for partisan voters to support someone of the opposite party. Cross-over voting, voting for the candidate of the other party, seems to be very unpopular today with many Republicans choosing thir d-party candidates over Trump and third-party candidates approaching 15 percent of the vote, according to the New York Times. While no candidate is likely to win the popular vote by a landslide barring an unforeseen scandal, the only chance of overwhelming victory resides with the Electoral College whose votes decide who our future president will be.
