<h2>On Veteran’s Day</h2>
<h4>By Catherine O'Neill</h4>

On November 11, if you see a veteran, then take a minute out of your day and make sure to thank them for all that they have done to keep our country free. 

Here are five facts about Veterans Day:

2.	It was originally called Armistice Day by Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. 

3.	Only around 855,000 veterans of the 16 million who served in World War II are alive today. 

4.	November 11 is the anniversary of the end of World War I. 

5.	The National Ceremony in Washington D.C. starts at 11 a.m. when a wreath is placed at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then is moved to the Memorial Amphitheater, where a parade of colors and speeches take place.
