<h2>The New SAT</h2>
<h4>By Catherine O'Neill'</h4>

In March 2016, the College Board held the first sitting of the newly redesigned SAT. This test comes with a variety of changes, aiming for the goal of aligning the SAT with what is currently taught in schools. In addition to redesigning the SAT, the College Board has teamed up with Khan Academy to provide all students access to SAT preparation in response to the claims that the SAT is not an even playing field for all social classes.

The most significant change to the SAT is that the scoring will be returning to the original scale of 400-1600 instead of 600-2400. The essay that was previously required will now be optional like the ACT. Additionally, the guessing penalty, which took 1/4th of a point off from oneâ€™s score for every wrong answer, will be eliminated. The math section will be split up into calculator and non- calculator and the impractical vocabulary will be gone.
