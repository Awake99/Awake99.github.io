<h2>The Immigration Debate</h2>
<h4>By Brian Glucksman</h4>


Immigration is one of the most talked about issues on the campaign trail. The five key questions are facing politicians are the following: 

<b>1.	What should be done about the undocumented immigrants in the United States?</b>

The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the federal government authority to deport all undocumented immigrants, but currently only felons are being deported.  Many Democrats are calling for amnesty for all undocumented immigrants in the United States, allowing them to stay indefinitely. In stark contrast, the most conservative Republicans are calling for more deportations, some even proposing the deportation of all undocumented immigrants.  The more moderate Republicans argue that certain groups of skilled immigrants should be able to earn residency. 


<b>2.	Should there be a pathway to citizenship?</b>

A pathway to citizenship would be a process by which an undocumented immigrant could earn citizenship. The partisan split is very sharp. Almost every Republican says undocumented immigrants should not be able to become citizens. Most Democrats firmly believe in a path to citizenship. 

<b>3.	What should be done about sanctuary cities?</b>

Sanctuary cities are cities that do not enforce current immigration laws and do not cooperate with the agency responsible for deportations—the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Some notable sanctuary cities are New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, and Houston. Many Democrats would like to make sanctuary cities irrelevant by stopping most deportations even though many Liberals would like to defund sanctuary cities. Republicans want to stop all federal funding to sanctuary cities to make them enforce federal law. 

<b>4.	Are the children of undocumented immigrants born in the states United States citizens?</b>

This is a constitutional question. The Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to guarantee birthright citizenship (citizenship to anyone born in America). The majority of both parties believe in birthright citizenship. However, some on the far right believe that birthright citizenship should be challenged in courts and in the legislatures. 

<b>5.	How should the United States secure the border?</b>

Both parties agree that the Mexican border needs to be secured; disagreement arises over how much the country should spend. Many Republicans have shown interest in building a wall and using monitoring drones on the southern border. Other members of the GOP have sided with Democrats in arguing for maintaining a system almost identical to the status quo.
