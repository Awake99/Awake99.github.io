<h2>Death of a Right Wing Legend</h2>
<h4>By Bailey Mirmelli</h4>

Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 79, was found dead at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury hunting resort in West Texas, on February 13th. The night before, he had attended a private party of around forty people, which he left early (though it did not seem unusual, as most guests were tired from traveling). In the morning, when he did not appear for breakfast, the resort owner found his body, and a Catholic priest was immediately contacted to administer last rights. Although the cause of his death was not immediately released, a spokeswoman for the United States Marshals Service reported that he died of natural causes.

The Sunday after his death, Scalia’s family declined an autopsy, so the body was prepared for his funeral and arrived at Washington the next day. His funeral was held the 20th of February, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and his other fellow justices, Vice President Joe Biden, and Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz joining his family to celebrate his life. However, President Barack Obama did not attend, drawing criticism from many conservatives. For instance, presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted, “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”

Furthermore, now that the Supreme Court is short a justice, questions arise about who will succeed Scalia and who will be the one to choose. As an executive branch check over the judicial branch, the President of the United States, with the approval of the U.S. Senate, has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices. But, with 2016 presidential elections coming right around the corner, is this responsibility of the current President or the next one?

Republican leaders, hoping to save Scalia’s seat for another conservative, have called upon President Obama to hold off any nomination and allow the victor of the presidential election to fill the spot. Nevertheless, according to research done by YouGov, only 34% of Americans believe that Obama should not nominate someone new, most holding that he should have the power to. However, this poses a problem for conservative political leaders, as President Obama, being a Democrat, would most likely nominate a liberal justice. Still, according to the same research, nearly a quarter of Republicans agree that Obama should nominate the new justice.

President Obama, however, did not wait long before beginning to work on finding options for replacements. The White House already has a narrowed list of vetted potential candidates. Top officials expect for him to have a final list soon.

Justice Antonin Scalia, nonetheless, will remain long remembered for championing a strict interpretation of the Constitution, writing vivid and moving opinions, and influencing the lives of many Americans.
