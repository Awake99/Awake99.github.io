<h2>Impeached or Re-Elected?</h2>
<h4>By Bhavik Rajaboina and Zakary Hori</h4>

President Donald J. Trump will go down as one of the most controversial leaders of the United States. His current approval rating is low, a shocking 37.3% (<em>FiveThirtyEight</em>). However, the supporters he has remain steadfast in their regard for the president.

First, some argue that President Trump could be impeached by Congress on account of his “reckless actions and abuses of power.” Like most know already, after taking office, he issued a travel ban, spurring much dispute. Across the nation, people rallied in airports to express their disapproval of the ban and how it violated their rights. The issue was so controversial that the Supreme Court convened to determine (and ultimately confirm) the ban’s constitutionality. Moreover, former FBI Director James Comey was fired by Trump because of his inability to continue the investigation on Hillary. Others, along with Comey himself, believe that he was fired for more contentious reasons (i.e. to prevent further investigation of Russian interference in the election). Also, his firing of forty-six Obama-nominated U.S. attorneys sparked criticism for the president (<em>New York Times</em>). After the Justice Department was asked about this move, it stated that the sweep was to “ensure a uniform transition” (<em>The Washington Post</em>). However, many believe potential reasons for this move include his pronounced contempt towards Democrats.

While President Trump still holds a controversial standing, he may be president for a second term in office. Despite ongoing battles between Republican and Democrat Congressmen, Trump is already looking ahead to another election. Recently, he has traveled across the country to attend multiple rallies for campaign advertising. Social media, news stations, and critics all publicly raise awareness of Trump’s policies and campaign. Having the advantages of being an incumbent, Trump will most likely garner some support, despite such low current approval ratings. After all, he did win the 2016 Presidential election after polls predicted Hillary Clinton taking the presidency. In addition, his direct statements seem to rally his base after such rallies and events. For instance, he states during the Phoenix rally, “It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage.” Nevertheless, while statements like this motivate supporters, they also incite contention.

So, could he be impeached or reelected? Or will he leave the presidency in 2020 as scheduled? With many on his side and many against him, only time can tell President Donald Trump’s fate as U.S. president.
