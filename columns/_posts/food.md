<h2>The Most Important Meal of the Day, Coming Your Way</h2>
<h4>By Bailey Mirmelli</h4>

Little do people know, September is designated as “National Better Breakfast Month,” raising awareness for breakfast’s significant role in a healthy lifestyle. For many, breakfast is low priority, or not one at all, in the everyday routine. Some believe that cutting out a morning meal saves time (especially after hitting the “snooze” twice) and even calories. However, studies have shown that eating breakfast every morning has a multitude of benefits, including improved memory retention and awareness, lower body mass index, greater access to nutrients, and quicker metabolism throughout the day (Rush University). So, why not start every day well with a delicious, nutritious meal?
