<h2>A Tragic Response to Tragedy </h2>
<h4>By Anonymous </h4>

Tragedy struck Las Vegas, Nevada, on the night of October 1st, marking what has become the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On the final night of a three-day country concert, the Route 91 Harvest Festival, a man brutally shot at the crowd with an automatic rifle from the thirty-second story of Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, located around only four hundred yards from the stage. Currently, at least fifty-nine people are dead, with hundreds more facing critical injuries. Over the week, these victims have become statistics. These numbers were living, breathing, human beings, including young children so small that they had to sit on their parents’ shoulders to view the stage. 

As country star Jason Aldean performed, the audience heard what at first sounded like firecrackers. The music continued for a few seconds before Aldean abruptly sprinted off the stage, and people began to panic as the first bodies fell. Many trampled over each other trying to reach the exits. It is reported that the shooter, who fatally shot himself after a SWAT team knocked down his hotel room, used nineteen automatic rifles, with even more firearms inside his hotel room. This horrific act of violence has shocked the nation, and really hit home for those who knew the people attending the concert. In fact, my own stepmother had several friends at the concert. One was shot in the foot, while the other, who was working at the concert, knew the area well and was able to escape quickly, taking back streets. 

Almost equally shocking to this brutal mass killing were some of the reactions to it. I witnessed many of my own peers making jokes about the tragedy, completely thoughtless to its severity. When I told one friend about my stepmother’s friend who escaped using back streets, remarked, “Wow. What a savage,” with a smile. I was astounded at such insensitivity. This was not pretend: hundreds of innocent people were injured, and even the survivors did not escape without scars of their own. Nobody would be able to sleep after witnessing such a harrowing event. But almost as disturbing were the many insensitive reactions that I witnessed. 

Now, we can only hope that after this tragedy, people will step up and ensure that firearms do not fall into the wrong people’s hands. Hopefully, we can shed some light in the darkness of what has become the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Hopefully, people will wake up and begin to care more about these horrible acts of terrorism instead of what the Kardashians are wearing.
