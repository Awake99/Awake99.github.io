<h2>Garbus’s Monthly Grumble </h2>
<h4>By Michael Garbus</h4>

<em>Author’s Note: You might be seeing this under the “Humor” section, but I can guarantee you, that this is 100% fact. I’ve been living under a box for the past week, and these nuggets of wisdom and truth I’m throwing out cost cash—please wire BTC to 1GJ8j4kx8Zkm7TMXSmNvfMjw7YKCepvRAj. It is the currency of the future and will keep fresh hot FACTS at your doorstep. </em>

BASIS students consider the loud, frigid air conditioning in the classrooms to be a serious problem. Some say it is an obstacle to their learning, while others may complain about the necessity of jackets when there are heat advisories outside. These complaints are mere delusions. I am here to explain why these problems are actually avant-garde advanced learning techniques that BASIS uses to enhance our brain power. 

Ever heard of machine learning? Probably not, because you think that having the room temperature below 70° F is a problem. Machine learning is the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In 20 years, the computer will be working that 120K-a-year job, and you'll be the one in the factory running quality control. BASIS recognizes this, and worked to solve the one question: “How can our students eventually compete with powerful AI robots?” Simple: computers work best at low temperatures, especially those below 70° F. By keeping us students consistently cold, we gain special skills only computers would have, like counting in binary, scoring 100% on standardized tests, and surviving without a heartbeat. 

You might say, “Hey, it doesn’t work like that! Humans can’t gain computer powers from temperature alone!” That’s why BASIS has put special rods in certain classrooms. Ever look up in any of the science rooms, and see a large metal rod hanging from the ceiling? You might believe that the rods are mere architectural errors occurring when the builders wanted to route the electric plugs through the rods for cable organization, but you are 100% wrong. Those rods send a 5 megahertz sine wave directly into our brains, slowly converting the nerves in our brains to CPU cores. 

“How can a school that doesn’t even have a football field convert humans into powerful AI machines? You probably made this all up,” you think. You’re wrong, again. For the past three weeks, my diet has been 500 milligrams caffeine, two bottles of College Board Energy JuiceTM, four pills of AlphaBrain, a bottle of Soylent, and brain functioning pills that have not yet been recognized by the FDA. Basically, I am on a higher mental plane than you, and it would take at least three years for you to catch up to where I am now, so just believe whatever I say blindly. Cold temperatures turn you into computers. 

If you still don’t understand how your problems are delusions and actually BASIS’s way of helping you, then I advise you to ask your nearest adult about what is going on. They will enroll you in a twelve-month course that will try to help you grasp how BASIS’s advanced techniques like this one make its students superior. After that, you should finally be able to join the enlightened ranks of BASIS students.
