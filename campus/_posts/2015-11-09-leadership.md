<h2>Leading a New Leadership</h2>
<h4>By Victoria Meyer</h4>

It is common knowledge that BASIS Scottsdale’s very own Leadership Society knows how to throw a good party—Prom, of course. However, aside from T-shirt sales and Spirit Week, Leadership has not been extremely active in the BASIS community. Ms. Das, the new Head of Leadership, acknowledging these changes, is determined to make this year’s operations extremely student-led, incorporating and collaborating with others to have plenty of new activities that promote a stronger school spirit.


For the first time in Leadership history, executive positions have been introduced. In addition to specific committees, Leadership boasts Co-Presidents Victoria Meyer and Elizabeth Barnitt, Event Coordinators Jayati Sharma and Seerat Jajj, Character Development Heads Mia Carlson and Sierra Yavari, Late Bird Heads Pooja Venugopal and Ashwath Vijayakumar, Cookbook Leader Rohith Boyilla, Candygram Leader Lauren Rasmussen, and Secretary Rachel Lincoln. That’s only to list a few.


Leadership’s members and administration alike have worked tirelessly to organize the details of the first new event: “Class Night.” On one fine night in April, seniors will rejoice at school for an evening to celebrate college acceptances, to spend time together, and to enjoy one final hurrah before embarking on the exciting, and only slightly scary, adventure of attending a school that is home to more than 600 students.


While currently unofficial, Leadership is also working to organize two different sporting events: a staff versus student basketball game, which is expected to take place one day after school, and an all-girls tag football game during the Junior-Senior Picnic. 


Alongside new high school events, Leadership, working with the Lower School, intends to create more school spirit and fun opportunities for Lower School students at BASIS Scottsdale, beginning with a revitalization of BASIS’s famous House System. Each student is sorted into his or her respective Hogwarts house. Certain Leadership members have been selected to serve as “Prefects,” and they will collect House points from each teacher to keep the system organized.


While this is only a short list of the many activities Leadership plans to introduce this year, students in all grades should cheer on their peers as they (hopefully) “destroy” our teachers in a friendly basketball game.
