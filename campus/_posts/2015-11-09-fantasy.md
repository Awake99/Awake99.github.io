<h2>Faculty Fantasy Football </h2>
<h4>By Raj Watson</h4>

Although BASIS Scottsdale doesn’t have a school football team, we do have something much better and much more competitive: fantasy football. While actual football may cause severe head trauma, fantasy football offers participants the opportunity to draft real- life players in the National Football League and earn points for their virtual teams without getting their hands too dirty. Every Sunday, the teams square off against each other head-to-head, and the team with the most points wins for that week. For the next sixteen weeks, former friends become ruthless enemies as the ultimate glory of Fantasy Guru is up for grabs.

In fact, the Bulldog Fantasy League, featuring star-studded talent such as Mr. Witz and Mr. Wells, has just gotten underway. With a total of fourteen teams, Mr. Molk oversees the entirety of the league as commissioner, so feel free to ask him any additional questions regarding the Bulldog Fantasy League. Finally, I wanted to give a mini-take on some of the standout teams in the BASIS Scottsdale faculty.

Mr. Witz, a determined veteran of the sport, keeps his eyes on the prize at all times as he seeks to attain the glorious title of Fantasy Football Champion for a second time. With the thirteenth selection in this year’s draft, Mr. Witz anticipates to win the majority of his points from his starting running back, Jay Ajayi. His main receivers, Kelvin Benjamin and Doug Baldwin, will surely give him a much-needed boost throughout the year.

Don’t let those glasses fool you; Mr. Wells is just as knowledgeable in fantasy football as he is in World History. Having had the fourth overall pick in the draft, Mr. Wells chose the elusive Julio Jones and followed up with defending MVP Matt Ryan to complete the lethal hookup. Although his running backs aren’t the best, Mr. Wells picks up the slack in the receiving core, adding Davante Adams and Marvin Jones.

An avid Arizona Cardinals fan, Mr. Ryan Carey plans to dissect any team that comes his way. Enraged at the fact that Cardinals running back, David Johnson, was no longer available to draft, Carey got one of the best wide receivers in the league with A.J. Green. Surprisingly, Mr. Carey has zero Cardinals players on his team. Hopefully, he can overcome, persevere, and realize that the Cardinals are just not that good anymore.
