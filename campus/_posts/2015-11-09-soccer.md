<h2>BASIS Bulldogs F.C.</h2>
<h4>By Gursajan Gill</h4>

In case you have not noticed, BASIS Scottsdale has a new varsity soccer team. After a tough week of tryouts and practices, only a handful of the twenty-five hopefuls who tried out for the BASIS team were chosen. Coached by Mr. Campbell, the Bulldogs kicked off their season against West Phoenix High School on September 3. Although the Bulldogs lost the game 4-1, they showed tremendous promise. 

This is the first year, in fact the first month, for Bulldogs Soccer â€“ meaning through practice and training, our Bulldogs can find winning ways and hopefully make BASIS Scottsdale proud. 

Not only is our soccer team a great addition to BASIS Scottsdale athletics, it is also a great addition to the BASIS social environment. Now, BASIS has another source of pride, beside the track team, basketball team or (the ever-revered) cricket team. The soccer team will hopefully bring a greater sense of community and school spirit to BASIS Scottsdale. Make sure to come to the Jewish Community Center to support the BASIS Bulldogs soccer team at their home games.
