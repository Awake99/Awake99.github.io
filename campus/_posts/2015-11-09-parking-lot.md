<h2>Revenge of the Parking Lot: Part 18</h2>
<h4>By Victoria Meyer</h4>

BASIS Scottsdale students can count on certain things each year as they walk through the double doors of the front office: a myriad of AP classes, messy bathrooms, and mobbed hallways. While we can choose our class schedules, clean up the bathrooms, and teach students to walk appropriately in the hallways, one aspect of the BASIS Scottsdale experience appears unchangeable: our anxiety-evoking parking lot.

Each year, students demand more parking options, more room for backing out, and less traffic blocking students in the afternoon. However, each year, it seems that the issue only worsens. With more students in our current senior class than those of the past two years combined, the administration acknowledged a need for change. Over the summer, the BASIS Scottsdale administration worked endlessly to create a new system for our parking lot. Some may have noticed the new paint job on the asphalt, the stop sign in the middle of the lot, and the designated spots for seniors to park. While these changes are admirable first steps, many still complain of backed up traffic and unfair parking assignments.

To reveal the sentiments of the school regarding the parking lot, I interviewed four people representing different perspectives: Alex Cohen, a senior not selected for a parking spot; Micki Calo, a senior selected for a parking spot; Mrs. Bailey, a math teacher; and Ms. McConaghy, the head of school.

Q: What are your opinions on the parking lot selection process for students?

Alex Cohen: It’s the most efficient way to deal with the large volume of parkers. However, I personally would prefer a “first come, first serve” program for seniors, where, if you get there early in the morning, you can get a spot, but if you come to class later in the day, it’s a “you snooze, you lose” situation.

Micki Calo: I agree with the school’s decision to give priority to those who car pool, or have siblings, but, at the same time, I understand those who are upset that they didn’t get a spot, especially the seniors.

Mrs. Bailey: I can see the logistics of that selection because you want to bring as many people to school without causing traffic jams, but I understand why people may think it’s unfair.

Ms. McConaghy: I was actually a bigger fan of random lottery, but when we ran the parking lot survey, it was the student’s lowest preference option. So, we had to honor their preferences and give greater weight to those that carpool more students.

Q: Do you think the changes, such as the new painted lines and stop sign, have made the parking lot more efficient?

Alex Cohen: I think the lot is more efficient. There’s a lot less chance of unnecessary risk in the parking lot.

Micki Calo: (long pause) I think that on the surface it looks more organized, but parents are still parking wherever they want. I think that it is overall an attempt to become more efficient, but it’s also hard for students to park in their designated spots when the lot is completely backed up.

Mrs. Bailey: It has definitely made it prettier. (laughs) Until they actually assign parking spot numbers to all people parking in the lot, I’m not sure how efficient it’s going to be. However, it is possible that the arrows have helped give direction to people who actually pay attention to the arrows and follow those directions.

Ms. McConaghy: Most definitely. We haven’t received any parent complaints about the traffic flow, and we’ve received many compliments on the improved traffic flow. We are also happy to have the overflow parking lot [the lot across the street] as an option to our students this year.

Q: Are there any changes that you would make to the parking lot system?

Alex Cohen: I still believe that the “first come, first serve” system, which we did last year, is the best policy. Additionally, students should not be leaving their backpacks in the trunk, especially the ones who need their parents to get out of the car to help them. All of that just makes the traffic worse.

Micki Calo: Honestly, I think seniority is the best option with a “first come, first Serve” policy, because we’ve waited to have these parking spots, and we won’t be here all year. Not that many seniors are even parking, so I don’t think it’s a big issue. We should also enforce carpooling more. Finally, parents should try and be more courteous to students when they pull into and out of the parking lot. A lot of the issues come from students not being able to access their spots because parents block them out. If they parents can just be more aware of students in the lot, things should be much smoother.

Mrs. Bailey: Even though this is hard to logistically enforce, I would definitely want to find a way to prevent parents from waiting for their students for more than ten minutes out there, as that really causes a backup in the lot. I think it is probably a good idea because, for example, the administration has walkie-talkies during fire drills. So, if we had two or three people walking around both outside and inside with walkie-talkies, they can sweep the hallways and parking lot, ask parents whom they are waiting for, and tell those students that their parents are waiting. This will make it easier to get students and parents out of the lot quickly. Unfortunately, our parking lot is so small that there really isn’t much that can be done. The only other idea that I can think of is, now that we’re using the parking lot across the street, parents who are waiting for more than five minutes can park over there and walk to school to pick up their children. This will help stop backing it up as much.

Ms. McConaghy: I think it’s the best it can be given our current restrictions, and of course I have to remind everyone to use the crosswalks! (laughs)

Although we all attempt to park in the same lot every day, perspectives differ on the efficiency of the lot. For many, the selectivity and backed-up traffic appear to be unfair burdens on students simply trying to get to class on time. However, the underlying benefits of the parking lot, such as less traffic complaints, may only be visible to the administration.

While a parking lot the size of Desert Mountain High School’s is not likely in BASIS Scottsdale’s future, the senior class of 2017 will be smaller than the current class of 2016. For next year, at least, be hopeful that the traffic will be slightly less hectic. Of course, this does not fix the size problems with our small parking lot, but it does provide time for students to become more creative with new solutions.
