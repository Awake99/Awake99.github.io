<h2>A Season of Giving</h2>
<h4>By Jayati Sharma</h4>

With the coming of the holiday season, opportunities for giving abound. What better way to celebrate the spirit of generosity than by participating in BASIS Scottsdale’s Red Cross-sponsored Blood Drive?

The drive will be held Saturday, December 5th from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m in the school gym. 

Before signing up, donors must check their eligibility. As a rule, students aged 16 and older must satisfy certain height and weight requirements, have parental permission to give blood, and turn in a form (talk to Sra. Slebos for more details).

To sign up, visit www.redcross.org/blood and search for BASIS Scottsdale (or use zip code 85259), make an account, and schedule an appointment. 

This is only one of two blood drives that the Red Cross club is organizing this year, so be sure to participate and give as you can. Happy Giving!
