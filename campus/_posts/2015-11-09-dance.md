<h2>Our 2nd Annual Fall Dance</h2>
<h4>By Axel Gogoi</h4>

This October, get ready for BASIS Scottsdale’s second Homecoming dance ever! Formally known as the Fall Dance, Homecoming, hosted by the BASIS Leadership Society, will be the first major Upper-School dance of the year, taking place on October 28th. Unlike last year, the dance will not feature a specific theme, like “Night Under the Stars,” but will instead embrace the fall colors that sadly are not present in Arizona.

Nevertheless, everyone in the Leadership Dance Committee is hard at work, making sure that this year’s Homecoming is just as successful as (or even better than) last year’s. This year’s dance will be held in the Lower School MPR instead of in the gym, owing to the “damage” done to the floor last year. Every effort is underway to ensure that the dance will be a success, including hiring last year’s DJ.

Tickets will cost $25 and may be purchased through Smart For Charters. Even if you aren’t one for dancing, you can still participate as a volunteer and get some precious in-school service hours. We hope to see you there!
