<h2>An Interview With The Savior Of Ap Government </h2>
<h4>By Nikola Djurisic </h4>

Government class has been difficult this year for freshmen students. The previous teacher, Dr. Ross, left early in the year, leaving the grade with a series of substitutes. But, Dr. Bae eventually filled the vacancy and set the class back on track. Curious about his plans for the school year and his experiences at BASIS so far, I met with him to ask a couple of questions.

<em>ND: What does it mean to you to be a part of the BASIS community?</em>

AB: I’m very honored to be on the BASIS Scottsdale team. When I got the referral from Ms. Mitrovich about the opening, I immediately sent in my résumé and applied for the position that same day. Now, I am grateful to work here. The support system that administration and other faculty members provide is invaluable and makes the community feel so hospitable.

<em>ND: Being the AP Government teacher, how will you incorporate the various political beliefs into your curriculum?</em>

AB: Well, there are certain things you learn in AP Government that are politically one way or the other. In terms of how the concepts or ideas we learn in class play out, students will have to describe the different political beliefs, especially when political parties are involved. Talking about different political beliefs may be touchy, but it’s something that we can't really avoid if we are going to be talking about our government.

<em>ND: What would you say is your favorite thing about BASIS so far?</em>

AB: It’s a school where, from the administration down to the students, there is a distinct culture extending beyond academics. You truly cannot find such a community at other schools.
