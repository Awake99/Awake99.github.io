<h2>Patriotic Voices</h2>
<h4>By Lauren Appel</h4>

BASIS Scottsdale’s a capella group, The Accidentals, will be featured on KOOL 94.5 FM each weekday from November 16-22 during the Noon Salute hour. The radio station chose The Accidentals’ recording of “The Star-Spangled Banner” from among the submissions of local schools. 
Three schools are featured every month. Under the leadership of Ms. Carbone and through the recording efforts of Mr. Hathaway, the Accidentals voiced their patriotism by performing our national anthem. Please tune in and enjoy.
