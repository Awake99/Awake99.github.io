<h2>In the Spirit of Spirit Week</h2>
<h4>By Jayati Sharma</h4>

More than just the advent of a scary, orange-blasted holiday, October signals the coming of BASIS’s famous Spirit Week. With teachers, students, and staff members alike donning their craziest and most creative outfits in anticipation of flaunting their full-blown Halloween costumes, Spirit Week guarantees four days of themed coordination that attracts all of BASIS together.

This year, Spirit Week will span from Tuesday, October 27th to Friday, October 30th.

Day one of Spirit Week will be centered on school spirit, perhaps the most important of all. Students will be strongly encouraged to come to school in whatever BASIS wear they own, from t-shirts to hoodies to even the once-popular sweatpants. Though a slight depart from the traditional “Green-Out” day, BASIS wear day strives to inspire students to express their love for BASIS in whatever ways they can, even if that means temporarily painting part of their skin green. 

A crowd favorite and popular choice among teachers and students, Pajama Day will take up day two of Spirit Week. Because Wednesday, October 28th also happens to be the day of the PSAT, Pajama Day conveniently calls for students, teachers, and staff to casually roll out of bed in their best and cheesiest PJs. Come to school wearing some onesie, in your kingly bathrobe, or even with your nostalgia-inducing childhood blanket. Live out the day in the comfort of a sleepier self. 

Inspired by the pointed success of previous attempts at “twinning,” day four of Spirit Week will be crazy twin day and dress-like-a-teacher/student day, with a twist. Students, teachers, and staff and their twins will be encouraged to come to school wearing not just similar outfits, but outrageous ones, in an attempt to stick out like needles in a haystack. Coordinating math-y ties and bicycle helmets is with no doubt enjoyable and humorous, but imagine coordinating temporary hair dye or glittery antennae.

Friday, of course, will be taken up by Halloween, wherein all BASIS community will arrive at school in witch hats, white ghost sheets, batman masks, cow costumes, and much, much more.

This year guarantees an enjoyable and engaging Spirit Week, and, with full participation, can potentially be the school’s most exciting one yet.
