<h2>The Basis Ambassadors’ Alumnus Spotlight </h2>
<h4>By Reyna Patel</h4>

Hey, everyone! We’re the BASIS Scottsdale Student Ambassadors, a group of enthusiastic kids that represents our school’s student body. We have partnered with the Gazette to bring you a new segment about our very own BASIS Alumni. Every month’s paper will feature a different student and what his or her life currently looks like. We hope this gives you an insight on what life is like <em>after</em> the rollercoaster that is the BASIS high school experience.

ALUMNUS OF THE MONTH: GITIKA VIRDEE

<em>BA: Where do you go to college and what year did you graduate from BASIS?</em>
GV: I’m currently a senior at Barrett, and I graduated from BASIS Scottsdale in 2014.

<em>BA: What are you majoring in, and why?</em>
GV: I’m a Global Health major with a minor in Business. I picked the major because it offered me a unique understanding of how socioeconomic factors influence communities around the world, like restricting access to healthcare in the United States, which is something I hope to address as a future clinician.

<em>BA: Are you doing research and/or other projects? If so, what are they?</em>
GV: I didn't do a lot of research in my undergraduate years, but I co-founded a project called Operation Toothbrush in my junior year of college. Operation Toothbrush is a hands-on dental education program for elementary school children that emphasizes the importance of oral health. Recently, it has gained national attention and is being incorporated into the curriculum at dental schools around the country. I'm excited to see what the future holds for this program!

<em>BA: What do you plan to do after you graduate from undergrad?</em>
GV: I am currently applying to and interviewing at dental schools.

<em>BA: What was your favorite part about BASIS, and what do you miss the most?</em>
GV: I miss the faculty! The teachers really became an integral part of my experience at BASIS. They really do want to help you succeed, so always feel free to ask for their help!

<em>BA: What is the most helpful tool that BASIS equipped you with to take on college?</em>
GV: BASIS taught me that I could accomplish anything with a little bit of planning. Whether that meant studying for APs, applying to colleges, or working towards my future career goals, planning ahead has always been my most important skill.

<em>BA: What was your best memory from high school?</em>
GV: Graduation. When you put on that cap and gown and sit next to your classmates, it finally dawns on you exactly how much you have accomplished in the last four years. You have a lot to be proud of. Making it through BASIS is no easy feat.

<em>BA: What is currently your favorite part about college?</em>
GV: College gives you a lot of freedom with your time and your interests. My favorite thing about college was getting involved with the ASU Pre-Dental Society during my freshman year. I learned a lot from my peers, and they have helped me get to where I am today!
