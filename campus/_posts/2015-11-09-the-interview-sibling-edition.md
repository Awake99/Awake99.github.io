<h2>The Interview - Sibling Edition</h2>
<h4>By Anuka Upadhye</h4>

Recently, I interviewed Mrs. Haag (the Honors Language, AP Research, and AP Seminar teacher) along with her brother Mr. Holt (the new P.E. teacher), to learn more about the dynamics of a sibling relationship in the work place. 

Question: Let’s begin at the beginning: where were you born and raised? 

Mrs. Haag and Mr. Holt: We were born and raised in Long Island, New York. 

Question: Who’s older, and what’s the age difference? 

Mrs. Haag: I am older, and we’re about three-and-a-half years apart. 

Question: Which expression characterizes your relationship as children: content as peas in a pod or fighting like cats and dogs? 

Mrs. Haag: Peas in a pod, definitely. We were always very, very close to one another. He has always been, and still is, my best friend.

Mr. Holt: Peas in a pod. 

Question: Has your relationship changed at all since you’ve matured? 

Mrs. Haag: No, I think we’ve just gotten closer as the years have gone by. I probably used to act more like a protector to him when we were younger, but now I just treat him like my best friend. 

Mr. Holt:  No.

Question:  Did you often pursue common interests?

Mrs. Haag: No, we never really did the same things, and we always had very different interests, so everyone used to say, “I can’t believe you two come from the same parents!” I was always very academically focused, more interested in reading and learning. He was always more interested in sports and music, so we always had different passions. 

Mr. Holt: I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit in music and stuff like that. 

Question:  What college did you two attend? 

Mrs. Haag: I went to SUNY Binghamton University. 

Mr. Holt: I went to John Jay and then the University of Buffalo. 

Question: Did you two talk at all about being teachers in the same school? Did you have any concerns or advice?

Mrs. Haag: I actually thought it would be a really exciting thing. I taught here first; this is his first year. Knowing my brother as well as I know him—like I said we’re best friends—I couldn’t think of a better person to teach kids. I know that he’s so passionate about exercise, fitness, and wellness that it was never a question of “Oh, can we work together?” It was about “Oh, I think you would do a great job!”

Mr. Holt: Yes, she gave me some advice about classroom management and getting to know the staff; she calmed any nerves that I might have had. 

Question: Is your relationship inside the school different than it is outside? 

Mrs. Haag: Not really, no! I just love him and want to hang out with him as much as possible, and I feel that way outside of school as well as inside of school. I’m sure sometimes he is dying to get rid of me, but I just adore him and love being around him. I try to do that in school as much as I do out of school. 

Mr. Holt: No.

Question: Has there ever been a time when you were glad your sibling was with you in school as a fellow teacher this year? 

Mrs. Haag: Well, when I’m feeling overwhelmed, it’s just nice to have him to say, “Chiiill.” It’s nice to have him there to say, “You’re being crazy right now.” It’s just that general supportive atmosphere. 

Mr. Holt: (Pauses) Every day’s cool. We get to hang out, so… 

Question: In three words, how would you describe your sibling?

Mrs. Haag: Good-looking, kindest-ever, and genuine. 

Mr. Holt: Loving, smart, and funny.

Listening to their camaraderie, the sentiments of Mrs. Haag and Mr. Holt sound unequivocal: working with a sibling makes a job more enjoyable.
