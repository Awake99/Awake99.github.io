<h2>Spanish Honor Society</h2>
<h4>By Trey Connelly</h4>

Look out NHS: there’s a new honor society in town. This school year marks the inauguration of BASIS Scottsdale’s chapter of the Spanish Honor Society. Officially titled the Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica (SHH), the society is sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP). The official mission statement of the SHH is “to recognize high school achievement in Spanish and Portuguese and to promote interest in Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian studies.” 

The BASIS Scottsdale chapter joins more than two thousand chapters worldwide. The school’s chapter currently consists of approximately 60 members enrolled in Spanish from 10th grade and above, a number which will likely increase in subsequent years as the society gains traction. Members of the society have been assigned to various committees, in charge of activities ranging from drafting of the chapter constitution to heading advertising campaigns for the society. Elections for officer positions will be held later in the year following the completion of the constitution.

Our school’s chapter already has several plans for activities promoting Hispanic culture in school this year. The society’s first event will be the construction of Altars de Muertos in honor of the Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead), a holiday celebrated primarily in Mexico but also throughout the Hispanic world. These altars will be in both cafeterias one week before and after the holiday, which takes place on the same day as Halloween.

The SHH also plans to represent several Hispanic countries in the school’s annual Day of Nations festival. Further activities, both in and out of school, will be planned and carried out later in the year.
