<h2>Red Cross Blood Drive</h2>
<h4>By Bailey Mirmelli</h4>

According to the Red Cross, every two seconds, someone in the United States needs blood. Luckily, Red Cross and other organizations work to prevent those people from going untreated by hosting blood donation drives. Donated blood is used by a variety of patients including the sufferers of cancers and blood diseases, surgical patients, orthopedic patients, and victims of physical trauma.

The last blood drive of the year at BASIS Scottsdale is on April 2nd from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the gym. Go to the Red Cross website to sign up as a donor at www.redcross.org (you must be sixteen years or older and have parent or guardian permission), because there are certain requirements you must meet before giving blood (which can be found on the Red Cross website). Signups are not limited only to those in the schoolâ€”family members and friends are welcome! Remember: just one pint of blood can save up to three lives.
