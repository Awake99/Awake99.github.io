<h2>Mac is Back!</h2>
<h4>By Yash Pershad</h4>

A familiar face is back at BASIS Scottsdale doing what he does best: teaching physics. After teaching at Phoenix Country Day School, Mr. McClernon or Mr. Mac, as students lovingly call him, has returned to teach eighth-grade Physics and AP Physics 2, and “team-teach” Capstone Physics.

Compared to past years, Mr. Mac is teaching younger students, eighth graders. He last taught them in his first year at BASIS in the 2010-2011 school year. Although he is accustomed to teaching Physics at the AP and Capstone-levels, Mr. Mac has fully embraced his new role. After allowing his new students to adjust to his teaching style, he is challenging them because he believes eighth graders can do “remarkable work.” He even said, “I’m treating them how I treated the older kids except I see them fewer days a week and a show a bit more Algebra.”

Although Mr. Mac likes the new campus with the “extra space” and easier access off of Shea, what he missed the most about BASIS Scottsdale were its two mainstays: the rigor and academic culture. Mr. Mac explains, “You can be as rigorous as you want, and the kids will respond positively.” Moreover, he loves seeing “old friends and students” and appreciates the welcoming he’s received.

When asked what the key is for students trying to learn and enjoy physics, his answer was simple: “Think! Don’t memorize formulas or equations.” He even chuckled and repeated what became his mantra when your author was his student, “Formulas are for babies.”

Even Mr. Mac’s signature Keurig machine and
red Nissan Leaf have returned to the BASIS Scottsdale campus. If you see Mr. Mac sipping on his coffee or helping a student with a tough problem, be sure to extend a warm welcome. After a year without him, I’m thrilled to say that Mac is back.
