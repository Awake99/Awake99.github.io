<h2>Assassins: It’s All Fun and Games... or is It?</h2>
<h4>By Nitya Aggarwal and Anya Wahal</h4>

For those of you unfamiliar with Junior/Senior Elimination, let us enlighten you. Elimination, more commonly known as Assassin, is a game that ends with only one victor, one monarch to rule them all, hunger- games style. It’s a game that slowly eliminates the weak until only one victorious team comes out alive. Let us assess the pros and cons of playing, or rather, the “I’ve Always Wanted to Stalk My Friends” side and the “Why Sometimes, Stalking Your Friends May Not Be the Best Idea” side.

<strong>I’ve Always Wanted to Stalk My Friends</strong><br/>
Let’s get the serious stuff out of the way. In actuality, playing Assassin is a BASIS Scottsdale tradition and an excellent way to send off the seniors before they head to college and never look back again.
Everyone plays. And it’s the only thing we’ve been talking about for weeks (clarification: the game only started two days before the writing of this article).
Playing makes you feel super cool and ninja-like. You get to “kill” friends, enemies, and people you’ve never spoken to, all in one, with absolutely no guilt.
But most importantly, winning Assassin means eight hundred dollars of Kona money, and BASIS students run on Kona.

<strong>Why Sometimes, Stalking Your Friends May Not Be the Best Idea</strong><br/>
Picture this: a squadron of sixteen-year-olds appear at your home, armed with water guns and determination. Would your parents be okay with this?
If you can’t drive and none of your friends can drive, there’s really no point at all.
The “team” concept is great and all, but there are only three paths here: your friends die before you, leaving you alone to face a world of ruthless, unidentified opponents; you die before your friends, which is obviously no good; or you and your friends win but now have to split the money. How is that a win?
It costs money. So much money. You have to pay to play, you have to pay (for safety items) not to die, and you have to pay (for water guns) to kill your targets. It’s ridiculous.
Amateur assassins, listen up: kill with care. Proceed with caution. Turn your Snap Map off, for heaven’s sake! Wear your floatie at all times (buy infant size: they’re smaller and easier to manage). Oh, and you should probably borrow enough money from your parents to get the game going in the first place. But if you don’t want to play? We get it. Following people around isn’t for everyone.
