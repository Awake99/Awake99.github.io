<h2>BASIS's Favorite Candies</h2>
<h4>By Michelle Faraz</h4>

This pie chart is a representation of a recent survey exploring BASIS Scottsdale students’ favorite candies. Unfortunately, a lot of candies did not make the cut, so if you’re stewing about how Charleston Chews are not included in graph, that’s because it had only one vote.

I’d also like to apologize to those who believed they were actually getting candy when polled. Nobody should have to experience such disappointment. Anyway, enjoy this chart, and use it to get your friends some candy. Have a great Halloween, everyone!
