<h2>Going Online</h2>
<h4>By Jayati Sharma</h4>

The BASIS Scottsdale Gazette has joined the leagues of many of the world’s biggest newspaper publications embracing technological advances with open arms. Yes, that’s right. The BASIS Scottsdale Gazette is going online. 

Starting this September, readers will be able to access their favorite monthly news source not only in print but also on the reaches of the World Wide Web at www.basisscottsdalegazette.com.

A long-awaited development, the Gazette Online will bring its audience a new, streamlined approach that makes accessing the newspaper’s many different sections simpler. 

Articles will be sorted based on genre, and featured columnists (check them out in this issue!) will be highlighted. Another important new addition to the BASIS Scottsdale Gazette will be its “Letters to the Editors” section, whereby readers will be able to ask questions, submit general comments, and provide feedback on the monthly publications. The publication is also looking to resurrect what was once known as the “Dear Abby” column.  Through the website, readers may be able to submit questions to this new column in hopes of receiving an answer in the next month’s issue.

No longer will readers be limited to black-and-white pictures. Pictures on the website will be published in full color, and avenues to include other media (audio and video) are currently being investigated. 

The online publication aims, as the BASIS Scottsdale Gazette always has, to bring its readership the most up-to-date news about both the school and the community at-large. Go online, take a look, and explore BASIS Scottsdale in a whole new domain.
