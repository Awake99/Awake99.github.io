<h2>￼City Council Abandons Easements</h2>
<h4>By Brian Glucksman</h4>

On February 23rd, by a six to one vote, the Scottsdale City Council abandoned the easements on the land of BASIS Scottsdale’s new campus. The city’s easements gave the city the right to use parts of the land for public uses like road expansions. The abandonment of easements liberates BASIS to build on the parts of the land that were reserved, so BASIS is now able to build the school as large as originally planned.

City Hall Kiva, the meeting place of the Scottsdale City Council, was not large enough to contain the 400 parents, students, and faculty who attended the meeting in support of BASIS. Over a hundred people watched the meeting from televisions outside.

At the beginning of the meeting, Jordan Rose, a lawyer representing BASIS, announced a development agreement between BASIS and the neighborhood group opposing the new school. BASIS promised to stagger start and end times, to build a signal on 128th Street and Shea, to widen 128th Street, to cap student enrollment at 1,215 students, to hire off-duty police officers to manage drop off and pick up, to limit the number of student drivers to 115, plant trees around the property, and to make an entrance off of Shea. The council also put up the development agreement for vote, and it also passed 6-1.

Several students, including sixth graders Avni Nigam and Lagia Manalostus, spoke on behalf of BASIS. In addition, many neighbors who initially opposed the new school supported the building of the school once the development agreement was reached.

Almost every city council member, however, was adamant that no school should be on Shea. As Vice Mayor David Smith said,” I will say unequivocally, I think this is a poor site for the BASIS School, in the interest of protecting the interest of safety.”

Councilwoman Virginia Korte and Councilwoman Kathy Littlefield also stated concerns about state overreach, arguing that the city should be able to dictate where schools cannot go. Councilwoman Korte said, “This is frustrating because legislators have taken away the city's authority to make a decision based on the zoning of this site and what's best for that site and what's best for Scottsdale and the impact to existing neighbors.”

Ultimately, six members of the city council voted in favor of abandoning the easements and the development agreement because they thought BASIS building with a development agreement was the safest option. Vice Mayor David Smith said, “I'm probably going to support this abandonment only because I want to get the development agreement. I don't want to see it developed without the development agreement because I think it would be even less to my liking.”
