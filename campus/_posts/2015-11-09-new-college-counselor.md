<h2>New College Counselor</h2>
<h4>By Lauren Appel</h4>

As the senior class has almost doubled this year at BASIS Scottsdale, the need for college counseling is correspondingly twice as great. Consequently, BASIS Scottsdale has hired a new college counselor, Ms. Conner, to join Ms. Mitrovich to better serve seniors during their college application odysseys. 

Enthusiastic about reaching out to students, Ms. Conner graciously agreed to answer a few questions, sharing her story to let us get better acquainted with her background and philosophy as a college counselor.

Q: The position of college counselor appears a bit daunting; you deal with seniors at a vulnerable time of transition, channeling their idealistic dreams into manageable realities. What first attracted you to your profession?

A: I started working with ASU freshmen in a class where they were undecided about what major they wanted to do. I helped them explore their options. I mastered at ASU and found a position at BASIS. Here, I am able to help students in a similar way at a very exciting point in their lives when they are applying to colleges. 

Q: What college did you attend, and what factors persuaded you to make that decision? In retrospect, do you believe it was the correct choice? 

A: I went to the University of Arizona for undergrad and ASU for my masters. To be honest, at that time in high school, I did not have a college counselor. Instead, I had a guidance counselor that I met maybe once. So I think my regret would be that I did not realize until after the fact how many options there were and how there are so many schools with great things to experience. I would say that I enjoyed my time at an in-state school, especially for financial reasons, but I also would have appreciated having someone show me all the different options that were available to me.

Q: How has the college application process changed since you were a high school senior?  

A: I did not even know about the Common App. I just went to the U of A and NAU websites and filled out the application, so my experience was very different. There is a lot more to it than I ever knew about at the time.

Q: Many Arizonian students wrestle with the East Coast/West Coast debate. What are your thoughts on the issue? What type of students would do better on which coast?

A: It is very much a personal fit question. Because the coasts are so different, visiting gives a great chance to see where you fit better. I think sometimes, if you put aside the types of programs you want, you will often get a gut feeling of which coast makes you feel the most comfortable. Even when you are daydreaming—picturing yourself in college—the type of environment you envision can give a clue. Are you on the beach enjoying the weather or are you bundled up and experiencing all the different seasons? Combining both a personal fit and a gut feeling will tell you where you see yourself. 

Q: In light of George Washington University’s recent move to drop its SAT/ACT requirements, joining over twenty other test-optional schools, do you foresee the demise of standardized testing in the near future?

A: I don’t think we will ever be able to get rid of the standardized test. Although I know it is daunting for every high school student, knowing that they have to take those tests, I think the tests are good starting points for colleges when looking at applications. I think they are here to stay.

Q: Not only seniors need pre-college advice. How can juniors and sophomores facing the redesigned SAT in 2016 best prepare?

A: The PSAT that the juniors and sophomores are taking this year reflects the redesigned version of the SAT. Thus, getting a feel from the PSAT will be helpful. Also, Khan Academy offers free online prep for the new PSAT and SAT.

Q: The biggest hurdle to overcome for many seniors blankly staring at the Common App essay prompts on their screen seems to be writers’ block. What is the best way to move from paralyzed to productive?

A: It is definitely a personal thing. Sometimes just sitting down and free-writing helps brainstorm ideas. Deliberately sitting down and trying to write your common app essay will often leave you coming up short. Instead, let it be a free and natural process of exploring your thoughts and ideas that arise when sitting quietly. Go back to any ideas or things that you wrote a few days later and re-evaluate. For other students, an outline helps order their thoughts. Come up with multiple ideas and always ask for feedback from many different people. Ask friends, family, teachers, and college counselors—anyone who you trust—to give you honest feedback. You can always ask your friends and family if they recall any salient stories about you to give you ideas as well.

Q: Can you recall the best college essay you ever read? What was its subject? Do you remember its opening line? Was the applicant accepted?

A: Ask me in December and I definitely will have an answer for you!

Q: What do you consider the top three qualities that make an applicant stand out from the crowd?

A: Writing a personal, interesting essay that really reflects who you are is vital to standing out in the crowd. The Letters of Recommendation are important as well, so make sure to establish close relationships with teachers. Finding the school that’s the right fit for you, not just the highest rank school is important too.

Q: “Fit” seems to be the current buzzword for the college admissions crowd. How can a senior know if a school supplies the right “fit” if he or she is uncertain about exactly “size” they are? How do you know if a school that fits you at 17 will fit you at 21? 

A: (Laughs) It is such a buzzword. If you have a chance to visit while the school is in session, that will be a great indicator. Do you feel excited when you are on the campus? Do the students seem to be people with whom you would enjoy spending four years? When we had the alumni panel come in, they made a few great points. Check out social media as well—Instagram can show you the type of students and the kinds of activities on campus. That’s a great way to find where you will be comfortable. Of course, you will grow from 17 to 21, but try to find a college that will foster that growth.

Q: Is it taboo to list “undecided” as your intended major on applications?

A: I don’t think so. For example, some schools, like ASU, have undecided programs. I think it is not a taboo at all.

Q: Unfortunately, sometimes a student, despite sacrifice and hard work, fails to secure a coveted spot at their dream college. What is the best way to overcome being rejected by your dream school?

A: I would advise having multiple dream schools and knowing that there’s not just one perfect school for you. Also recognizing that, while it is difficult facing a rejection, it is not always personal. The school might be looking for particular individuals that year. With the most selective schools, it usually is not any failure on the part of an applicant but rather just a factor of how highly competitive the school is.

Q: The college admissions conundrum seems to, ironically, climax with post-acceptance problems. Imagine: your mailbox bursts with several fat envelopes, a veritable college acceptance cornucopia. It is time to celebrate, right? What, however, happens when you and your parents disagree on which college to accept? 

A: That is a tricky situation, one that leads to a couple of difficult conversations. That’s when I would absolutely suggest that you and your parents come in to either Ms. Mitrovich or me to have a conversation. You must be respectful and understand where your parents are coming from, while still being honest and really expressing why you want to attend that school.

Q: On that same note, pulling the trigger and committing to one college on May 1 seems to cause anxiety in even the most confident applicant. One month seems like an awfully short time to decide where to spend the next four years. How can students best prepare to make that final decision with conviction?

A: Applying early action is really helpful for whatever schools you are interested in. That way you get your decision back in December or January and have more time to think about it or visit the school. No matter what, your official decision on which college to attend will cause anxiety because it reflects such a big change. Therefore, try talking to your friends and family for advice.

Q: Mark Twain once noted, “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did.” What should every senior strive to accomplish this year?

A: Although it is a stressful time, seniors should strive to make the most of their last year of high school, joining any clubs or extracurriculars, which they always wanted to join, and taking advantage of all the opportunities that BASIS has to offer. Seniors should be open to new experiences.

Q: Since seniors are just at the start of their college search saga, could you impart some advice on the best way to make the journey enjoyable?

A: Keeping in mind that you spend 50 minutes every day in a college counseling course—an opportunity most other high school students lack—you have more time to work and meet those deadlines. Thus, students can relax more and enjoy the ride. Encouraging your classmates also helps create a supportive and communal atmosphere. Seniors should look at applying to colleges not as getting accepted or denied but as the opportunity to really discover and explore what you enjoy and where you see yourself.

Speaking with Ms. Conner places the college search into its proper perspective: a time for self-reflection. Seek her out for support, direction, and insight. She definitely is the perfect “fit” for BASIS Scottsdale’s senior class.
