<h2>Bulldogs Basketball</h2>
<h4>By Raj Watson</h4>

After we said goodbye to graduated players — Yu Sang Ma, Max Waaler, Sachin Pathangey, Russell Llave, Praneeth Batte, and Arjun Gupta — the next generation of BASIS Scottsdale Bulldogs must emerge. With a new gym, the entire school is excited for the new season. Tryouts took place on the October 24th and 25th. Coach McConaghy told all the hopefuls “to leave it all on the court” and “battle through adversity when times get tough” in a motivational speech before the players fought for a spot on the team. Ultimately, the field of 24 hopeful students was narrowed down to a team of 12 determined athletes.

The cuts were made on October 30th, and Coach McConaghy told the hopefuls that this year was the hardest year to make cuts for the Varsity Basketball team. With so many talented players on the floor, Coach McConaghy was torn in trying to decide who made the squad. The final roster for the BASIS Scottsdale Varsity Basketball Team is as follows:

Brent Armistead, Ved Narayan, Ameya Kapur, Amaan Maredia, Raj Watson, Dev Kabra, Joey Peles, Joey Reed, Saaketh Narayan, Jack Flaherty, Nathan Swift, Nishant Kannan, Ravi Patel and Case Parsons.

With the addition of young, raw talent, the Bulldogs hope to clinch another berth in the Arizona state tournament. BASIS Scottsdale plays in a competitive league called the Canyon Athletic Association (CAA), where teams are placed into 3 divisions. BASIS Scottsdale is placed in Division II with teams like Desert Heights, BASIS Peoria, and BASIS Chandler. Practice for the Bulldogs is already underway, as Mr. Holt helps prepare the team with conditioning. Games for the Bulldogs happen every Thursday starting in November.

We need the help of the entire school to help cheer on our Bulldogs during home games, so bring funny (but appropriate) signs, dress in green, and do whatever it takes to help the Bulldogs protect our brand-new gym.
