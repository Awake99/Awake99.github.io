<h2>Jack Reacher - Never Go Back</h2>
<h4>By Varun Kukunoor</h4>

Though Jack Reacher: Never Go Back was highly anticipated, it simply did not meet the viewers’ standards. With the expectation of a film even more exciting than the original Jack Reacher, which was a major success at the box office, the general audience was extremely disappointed. Although Tom Cruise successfully reprised his role of Ethan Hunt – sorry, ex-Major Jack Reacher – the movie failed to provide an understandable plot and gave too much screen time to lesser characters.

The action flick promisingly opens with Jack Reacher exposing two cops for their illegal activities and keys viewers who missed the first movie into the character-defining angst and solitude of Jack Reacher. This leads him to befriending a member of the military police of Washington D.C. (Cobie Smulders). He soon realizes she has been falsely convicted for espionage, and that the security of the military police has been compromised. At this point, the story seems promising, but the film is then dragged on by unnecessary dialoge and scenes

Ironically, the more the characters spoke, the more confusing the plot became. The movie was not well received, as it presented mindless action and unrealistic events that seemed to have no importance to a lacking plot. While it did use big names Tom Cruise and Cobie Smulders to build interest, it simply never lived up to the hype. Jack Reacher:Never Go Back serves as an excellent example of a film that bombed even with a great cast and crew.

There is no reason to watch this movie. All in all, if you want a well-made action film to spice up the weekend, just watch Top Gun again. You get Tom Cruise and a decent film.
