<h2>"Gameshow"</h2>
<h4>By Luke Forsman</h4>

Eighties fans pull out your Ray-Bans and acid washed jeans—your music is making a comeback. Two Door Cinema Club’s new album Gameshow is leading the charge. Released October 14th 2016, four years after the Irish band’s last album, it has reached a peak of 5th, three spots behind their previous album. Two Door Cinema Club, in the past, has been known as a pop electric band, and this album takes that trend to a whole new level.

They transitioned from a modern pop of their previous albums to an 80s pop with this album. They use many sound effects and synthesizers to capture the 80s feeling that Duran Duran rode to stardom. The three singles they released earlier this year “Are We Ready?,” “Bad Decisions,” and “Gameshow” are very representative of the multigenerational inspiration in the entire album. While “Are We Ready?” and “Bad Decisions” have the characteristics of songs from the 80s, “Gameshow” is a little more modern. If you are a little hesitant to drop the $12 to buy the whole album, those three songs are a good place to start. Songs that stand out from the rest include “Lavender” and “Sucker.” Both of these songs, although they still feel like 80s songs, have their own twist. “Lavender” is a slower, less complicated song compared to the rest. It uses fewer sound effects and lower-pitched vocals. “Sucker” is similar to “Lavender” because of how slow it is, but has a darker feeling to it. All of the other songs are very similar, all using sound effects extensively with very high-pitched vocals and guitars. When pressing the skip button, it can sometimes be hard to tell if you actually on a different song because the vocals of all the songs are in the same tone and pitch.

In general, Two Door Cinema Club’s attempt to bring an electric 80s feel back was pretty successful both in their ability to create this sound and the reception of it by the public. In terms of the music itself, many of the songs seemed unoriginal, but are still worth a listen if you want something different from modern pop. I give Gameshow by Two Door Cinema Club 3.5 stars out of 5.
