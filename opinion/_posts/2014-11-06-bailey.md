<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
<h4>By Bailey Mirmelli</h4>

The school year has begun, and you have already forgotten what it feels like to be fully awake. Also, SATs, PSATs, and college application deadlines are just around the corner. So, how will you stay awake? Luckily for you, the answer may very well be something you already enjoy doing: eating. Foods such as avocadoes, blueberries, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and nuts are proven to energize brain processes and support a full day of thinking and working. But who really wants to eat these “super” foods? After all, they never seem to taste quite delicious by themselves. Here are some wonderfully delicious ways to turn starting a day healthy from what feels like a chore to something you can look forward to.

<b>Ezekiel French Toast</b>
<i>What you need:</i>
<ul>
<li>2 slices Ezekiel bread</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon honey (optional, but recommended)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coconut oil (to grease the pan, but if you do not have, any cooking spray will do if used lightly)</li>
<li>toppings of choice — can be anything from blueberries to chocolate syrup (if you want a little sweet with it)</li>
</ul>

<i>Instructions:</i>

1. Heat a non-stick pan over a low to medium. Grease the pan with the coconut oil.

2. Scramble eggs, milk, cinnamon, and honey in a medium bowl, and transfer egg mixture in a separate dish.

4. Move onto pre-heated pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown.

5. Serve warm with toppings of choice.

<li>1⁄2-1 banana (depending on size of banana)</li>
<li>3⁄4 cups light vanilla soy milk</li>
</ul>

<i>Instructions:</i>
