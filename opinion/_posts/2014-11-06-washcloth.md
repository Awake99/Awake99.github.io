<h2>Washcloth's Woes - The Yard</h2>
<h4>By Ashwath Vijayakumar</h4>

Something is off about this school. I’m not talking about the undersized hallways or the racetrack of a parking lot surrounding the school. I’m referring to the yard. Our school was built with mysterious intentions, and our beloved L-shaped playground is eerily reminiscent of a prison yard.

Whenever I enter the school through the side entrance, I cross the moat of busy parents guarding the school with their line of cars. The 6-foot-tall rusted grey gates (we are in the desert and they are brand new; how are rusting already?) towering over me captures my attention as I attempt to enter the school. Were these black gates really necessary? Just add a couple of watchtowers on every corner of the gated area and tint the windows, and we are right back in the middle of the panopticon.

Speaking of watchtowers, always be on the lookout for the guards. If someone airballs receiver #14 on a go route and the ball flies over the fence into the small patch of desert in front of the school, then you can say sayonara. Everyone has to pack up and go back to their mundane lives eating lunch inside the building. No one is allowed to pick up the ball; no one can sign out and get it. Only the guards can go retrieve the ball. And when they bring the ball back, game’s over.

No one is intentionally gunning to sail their passes over the fence like CP3, so why punish them for a mistake? It really doesn’t change anything at all if an adult walks outside the perimeter, grabs the ball, and gives it back to the children to continue to play. However, I do understand why safety mandates that students cannot leave the fence. Sooner or later, our yard will be known for its monstrous 4- square scene, but for now, all students talk about is the fence.

Besides the functioning if-a-ball-goes-over-the- fence-go-back-to-eating-lunch policy, the theme of the yard is quite peculiar. The yard is constantly monitored and the children are on a tight leash. The astroturf, although nail free, is now plagued with leftover lunch from careless kids. And there is a large stone area in the center of the field.

I have some suggestions for the planning commission. We should introduce weight sets to encourage a collaborative community where inmates can bond together pumping the iron. Toss in some barbed wire around the outside of the fence to discourage hopping the prison walls.

The vision of the yard was to be the first grass recreation area for BASIS student. However, the rusting fences are ruining the feeling and purpose of the new planned space.
