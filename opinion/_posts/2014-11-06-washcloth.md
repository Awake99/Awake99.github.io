<h2>Washcloth's Woes: Cell Phone Nightmares</h2>
<h4>By Ashwath Vijayakumar</h4>

Recently if a teacher who usually isn’t bothered by phones has told you to put your phone away, that is due to a recent Instagram scandal. A student took a picture of another student and posted it on Instagram. The parents of the student were upset and approached the administration. And now we have the enforcement of the cellphone rules.

What annoys me the most about the recent cellphone crack down from the administration is that it annoys the student body. But in reality students should know the drill, someone, somewhere does something stupid on school grounds, it ends up on some social media website, some parents get angry, the school reinforces the phone policy, and the teachers and students inevitably restart bad habits and forget the rules. You shouldn’t be angry about the cellphone ban in classrooms, instead just wait for the inescapable future when everyone forgets it exists. The “ban” is pretty cyclic.

Should we really be using our cellphones in class? No. And let us instead focus on the main issue, the total banning of cellphones. I heard some rumors from an member oft the BASIS staff rumors of an absolute cellphone ban coming with the new school. Unfortunately, the practicality of enforcing such a ban is pretty low, and there will probably be tons of backlash from students. is no need to worry about an actual campus wide ban.

The administration has been great to the BASIS Scottsdale community and student body, and they probably know, better than I do, that the success with an in class ban lies not within the students or the teachers but rather with constant reminders to break the cycle of laziness that happens with our spectacular student body.

But that does not mean the students here agree with me for the same reasons.

Abby Marcolini(@SLUGSEVERYWHERE) tweets, “￼￼@Chubbygoat8 i like the cellphone ban because it makes me feel rebellious when i check the time during class (don't kill me Mr. Garvey)” 

Mr. Garvey will enforce the ban, but I doubt he’ll take it that far.

And as a side note, whenever you ask a friend for some help make sure you make it crystal clear what you want.

After having a small conversation with Manu Vegunta (@veguccii) asking for help with this article he tweets,[view conversation below]

And some friends may even get offended, Daphne Li-Chen (@daphne_lichen) tweets, "Offended @Chubbygoat8 didn’t accost me for a tweet about the cell phone policy."

The rules have been and have always been the same, before and after the Instagram scandal: Don’t use your phones in class, and don’t take pictures on school grounds. You, the administration, and the parents don’t need any extra problems. Just don’t use your phones in class for the rest of the year, or at least get better at hiding them.
