<h2>College Therapy?</h2>
<h4>By Brian Glucksman</h4>

BASIS Scottsdale does not need a college counselor; it needs a college therapist. Our perception of high school as a four-year hurdle to jump before college is insane. 

In a school as competitive as BASIS, excelling in your courses, not to mention goldening your balloon, requires such an immense amount of work that your good grades may not feel like reward enough. However, it is foolish to view getting into a selective college as the payoff for all your work. 

The danger of externalizing motivation—what happens when college is the incentive to do things well— is that you will not want to do that thing anymore. In an experiment, psychologists Mark Lepper, Daniel Greene, and Richard Nisbett gave freedom to a large group of preschoolers to choose the activities that they wished to do. Many chose to create art.  The researchers devised three experimental groups from the pool of children who enjoyed crafts and motivated each group to continue to choose to make art: the first group was told ahead of time that each of its members would get a prize for making art, the second group was given prizes for making art but was not informed of the potential for rewards, and the third group was uninformed and did not receive any prizes. What were the results? The second and the third group, who made art purely for their own enjoyment, continued making art at the same proficient rate; the first group, however, lost almost all interest in art as soon as they perceived it as a means to an end. At BASIS, we are the artless children, stripped of any intrinsic enjoyment, like learning for learning’s sake, by the promise of college.

Even if you have no intrinsic motivation for learning, you stand to lose if college is your motivation. Social psychologist Leon Festinger, famous for his cognitive dissonance theory, found in his experiment that as he gave undergraduates more money to perform an intolerably boring task—like spinning a wheel or stacking spools—they would be less likely to rate the task as engaging and fun. After doing a mind-numbing experience—which school is for many of us, frankly—the brain justifies wasting that time. If it not given a large external reward then the brain is able to trick you into thinking that boredom was enjoyment. If you are motivated by college, you are less likely to look back at high school and to think that it was fantastic.  

Is the carrot of getting into a selective college at the end of the stick of high school compelling enough? Not really. Ten years ago, economists Alan Kruger and Stacy Berg Dale found that there is no short-term or long-term difference in earnings between students who were accepted into a selective university but did not attend compared to those who were accepted and did attend a selective university. Additionally, according to the National Survey of Student Engagement, the difference in how intellectually engaged a student reported to be diverged widely within the same universities and was mostly shaped by other factors. 

So what can BASIS do to move away from its focus on college? Unfortunately, taking down the pennants from the North Cafeteria would not be enough. First, BASIS should distance students and parents from the college application processes as long as possible. There is no reason a sophomore should be talking with college representatives or a freshman spending his time at a college informational meeting. Second, BASIS should stop publishing the lists of college acceptances; let us appreciate the hard work and accomplishments of the graduating class without needing them validated by college acceptances. Third, BASIS should remind students to focus on the “here and now” of our school’s unparalleled educational opportunities rather than the “if and when” of college speculation. 

We have made the BASIS experience unlike anything else. Should we not enjoy this environment which we have created? Let us retake our high school years back from college.
