<h2>Cohen's Complaints: Thanksgiving me a Headache</h2>
<h4>By Alex Cohen</h4>

Thanksgiving is a storyteller’s dream holiday: throughout its rich history, there have been several key moments that – for better or worse – have made the holiday what it is today.  Who could forget the made-up story about the time White people failed to grow corn and took advantage of kindly Native Americans whom they would later violently displace from sacred land?  Or, in 2012, when Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez ran into someone’s rear end, fumbled the ball, and proceeded to lose the game? How about the eleven-year-old child sent to the hospital when early Black Friday Shoppers at Wal-Mart trampled him in 2013? Regardless of what your personal favorite Thanksgiving story is, I’m sure that the central lesson is the same in all of them: people are greedy, gluttonous, and only care about their own well-beings. 

My only issue is this:  why, on a holiday so devoted to the positive advancement of selfish goals, are people forced to spend time with their families? 

Regardless of what you call them, you can be assured that your grandmother and grandfather will show up for Thanksgiving dinner. In my house, this can mean that I will be treated to my grandfather’s wild gestures and colorful language as he rambles about the decay of modern America, but it can also mean that I will spend the night talking to my grandmother about why today’s music actually does have value (see Jayden’s Jams). Still, grandparents only touch the tip of the Thanksgiving family iceberg; you also have your gluten-free-sugar-free-oxygen-free aunt and her husband, your cousins who only talk about their school and their hometown, and the family member you only associate with on Thanksgiving to clear your conscience. 

Having family over isn’t inherently a bad thing, however; on any normal day, you can lose yourself in television, video games, or “BASIS homework” and avoid talking to them altogether. Thanksgiving is a little different in that it forces you to talk to them. If you try to lose yourself in binge eating, you win in the short term, but you lose in the long term, kept in your seat by the sheer weight of food you’ve just consumed. 

Oh, and that reminds me, the food on Thanksgiving is a sin. 

Just think about it for a second. It’s Thanksgiving night, and your mother brings in a delicious, succulent turkey. She elegantly carves the turkey onto your plate, and you are soon lost in the combination of the fragrant turkey seasonings, the piquant or savory stuffing piled onto your plate in mountains, and the rivers of rich, thick gravy that tie it all together. You’re about to take a bite. You close your mouth around the juicy bird and its accouterments. Mmm. Yummy. Except – what’s this? Oh. It’s A BIRD FEATHER BECAUSE THANKSGIVING REVOLVES AROUND THE SYSTEMATIC BEHEADING OF INNOCENT TURKEYS, MAJESTIC ANIMALS THAT BEN FRANKLIN WANTED TO MAKE OUR NATIONAL BIRD. THE GRAVY HAS DEVELOPED A THIN SKIN, AND THE STUFFING ONLY TASTES LIKE TURKEY BECAUSE OF THE VILE PLACE IN WHICH IT WAS COOKED. OH, AND THE RIDGES ON THE CANNED CRANBERRY SAUCE LOOK REALLY NATURAL AND TASTY. 

Despite the food, family, and underlying selfishness that Thanksgiving promotes, there are two positives that come out of it. First, some saintly people choose to donate food to others, spreading the cheer and promoting the togetherness that Thanksgiving is ostensibly rooted in. Second – and more importantly – Black Friday is the next day. Just be careful not to trample any kids this year. 

Other than that, there isn’t much to complain about.
