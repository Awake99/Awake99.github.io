<h2>Cohen's Complaints: Halloween Hang-Ups</h2>
<h4>By Alex Cohen</h4>

When I was two years old, my mom and I went on the first of many walks through our local Party City in early October to search for a Halloween costume. She was excited to do a paired costume with her little pudgy toddler, something masculine and exciting like Steve Irwin (remember, this is the early 2000s) and another safari-going adventurer. 

I had other plans, however; toward the end of our peripatetic Party City search, I spotted something that I must have thought was the clear answer to our costume dilemma. 

“Mommy! I be baby cow and you be mommy cow!” I excitedly said. 

“Honey, I’ve been spending my whole life trying to avoid being called a cow. I don’t want to do that.” 

Still, two-year old me had his way, and my mother and I were calf and mother cow for Halloween. 

That’s my main beef with Halloween: it’s a selfish holiday. 

For that reason alone, I assure you that group Halloweens are never fun. For example, if you and all of your friends dress up as Elsa or some other comparable queen of commercialism, you might take an Instagram picture saying “Elsa Squad! #qween #3hot5you,” but in your heart, you’ll think that your costume was the best. Even if your dress is an old blown-out potato sack painted blue and clumsily adorned with one bedazzling crystal, the mental need to self-serve will convince you that you must be the single best Elsa that ever Elsa-ed. 

Really, group discord is unavoidable. If you think you’ll get around it with an “amazing” group costume idea, there’s always a chance that you’ll get stuck with the worst costume in the bunch but be forced to go along with it anyway. See, I didn’t care in the slightest that my mom would have to dress up as a notoriously fat animal, because the group costume idea made me happy. Oh what’s that, we’re all going to be Marvel superheroes? I want to be Thor! Oh, you’re Thor? What’s that? The only superhero left is Ant-Man? Well…all right.

Beyond being another excuse for you to dislike your friends behind their backs, Halloween also provides multiple reasons for you to dislike complete strangers. 

On Halloween, you are guaranteed to see a retinue of memes (wow, dank Rare Pepe costume), short-lived pop culture jokes (that’s an awesome Ebola nurse costume), and shamelessly repurposed costumes that are no longer relevant (I didn’t even know they still sold George W. Bush costumes). It’s a living holiday, people, and trends change: if you show up at my house dressed as Left Shark from the Super bowl halftime performance, then you won’t be receiving any candy. 

And on the point of giving/receiving candy, does anyone else think that we need to rethink a holiday where people send their children knocking on strangers’ doors asking for candy? It seems pretty intuitive that you wouldn’t want random people giving your children things in the dark and sticking them quickly in a dark bag. A Milky Way for you, a Baby Ruth for you, and a hypodermic surgical needle wrapped in used tissues for you. Happy Halloween, you crazy kids!

Don’t let all of my complaining fool you, I love Halloween for what it truly is – an enormous excuse for people to judge each other all around. I just don’t like how my feet hurt when I walk too far, how stuffy the costumes are, how most of the candy is terrible anyway, how most of the parties are generic, and how many unknown things are lurking in the dark. Oh, yeah, and the selfishness that I mentioned before. 

Other than that, there isn’t much to complain about.
