<h2>How Smart is it for our Charter?</h2>
<h4>By Divya Vatsa</h4>

It’s lunch, and your classmates have just finished making an announcement about the upcoming Yule Ball. You can already picture all of your dressed-up friends; you can hear the music; you can taste the sugary refreshments. The dance sounds like fun. And then you hear the mention of SMART for Charters. Now you are significantly less interested in attending a dance that only five-seconds earlier you were already anticipating in your head.

Until recently, I was decidedly indifferent toward this system−it never really concerned any of the events that interested me. However, my opinion changed in October, when a club, in which I participate, hosted a fundraiser at school. Since the event was occurring in school, we were required to use SMART for Charters for raising all monetary contributions. In the words of one student, “Well since we have to pay through SMART for Charters, I’m not sure if I will be able to contribute to this event.” My initial response was confusion as to why SMART for Charters would prevent students from taking part in school events.

Now I see that the dilemma is quite simple. Before SMART for Charters, all students needed to do was bring cash to school and pay at the door. Often times, students carry an extra dollar or two with them anyway, so even if they forgot about an event, they would still be able to contribute on the day of the event. However, the new payment system forces us to remember every single event that is happening at school, tell our parents which ones we want to attend, commit 100% to attending the event, and verify that our parents have paid before the deadline. All these preliminary steps require extra memory space, meticulous future planning, and coordinated organization. I know that I am not alone in my sentiment that this feels like too much work and effort, especially during academic marathons, like the trimesters. 

To be fair, let's understand some reasons why the administration would implement this system, despite its lack of popularity among students. Although a hassle, SMART for Charters provides an organized means of collecting money for school events. The school can quickly see the exact amount of money raised and the identity of contributors. Parents can see exactly which events their students attend, as well as alleviate constantly prodding their child to turn in fees. In fact, SMART for Charters has been very effective for extracurricular activity registration. 

BASIS administration implemented SMART for Charters at the request of their external audit firm as way to minimize cash in the schools because cash is more difficult to track and record accurately. This system is used by all BASIS schools.

As a result, we should not completely bash SMART for Charters. While the school’s intent in adopting it was to promote efficiency, the main consideration should be how students react to this system. On the whole, we do not seem very inclined to put in the effort to pre-pay. Unfortunately, sometimes, the consequences are that our student body is unable to come together like we used to at school events prior to the domination of SMART for Charters. Until we devise a solution to this perplexing problem, some students will have to keep bombarding the rest of us with announcements during lunch until we are annoyed enough to finally submit to our charter’s smart payment system.
