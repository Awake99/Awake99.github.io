<h2>Lost, Never Found</h2>
<h4>By Daphne Li-Chen</h4>

So, now that we’re firmly into the school year (and quickly nearing the end of Trimester 1-- cue the ominous music that precedes trimester finals), it’s time to discuss some helpful tips to help manage that growing pile of school supplies you have.

The general rule of thumb is less is more. Do you really need to have that many pens and pencils? The likelihood you needing those four different shades of blue is very very low. Now, you may ask: How could I possibly get rid of all these school supplies that I have? The answer is simple — allow the BASIS black hole to suck your belongings away into oblivion. As long as you leave your items alone in a public area in the school for more than a couple of minutes, you’ll be sure to lose either a few or, in some especially lucky circumstances, all of your stuff. Graphing calculators (even measly CX’s), lucky pencils (and even entire pencil cases), binders, and notebooks are all easily sucked up into the void. Don’t be afraid of being forced to find your stuff again, 99% of the time it will never come back, and the other 1% of the time it will be returned in a wholly altered and damaged state.

Do not be afraid of the lost and found. The lost and found will never return your items. Though they somehow remain perpetually full, they never spit out anything other than grimy clothing (but really how did someone lose their pants?) and lunchboxes full of rotting food. After BASIS successfully sucks up anything of value to you, where it ends up is never the lost and found.

Remember, it’s never too early to start your spring cleaning!

Until next time, DLC
