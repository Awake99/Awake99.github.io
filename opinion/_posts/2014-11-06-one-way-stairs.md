<h2>One-Way Stairs</h2>
<h4>By Trey Connelly</h4>

Stairs: they have their ups and downs. But what many BASIS Scottsdale students still don’t realize after two years is that one of our stairwells only has ups, and the other only has downs. They are even conveniently labeled “Up Stairs” and “Down Stairs.” yet somehow students continually go up or down the wrong set of stairs.

Many students simply don’t bother following this policy because they don’t understand why it is in place. They view their own need to get to their lockers and to get to class as more important than some silly rule. However, there are very good reasons why the stairs should remain one-way only.

Firstly, stairs can be very dangerous. Just ask anyone who has died falling down a flight of stairs. Then ask yourself why you’re talking to a corpse. After reassuring yourself that you are totally sane, you’ll see why it’s much safer without having stairway collisions.

Secondly, this policy is an important step toward reducing hallway traffic. As any student who has consecutive classes on opposite sides of the school knows, BASIS students are very good at creating traffic jams. The two-way traffic in the halls results in a very slow flow of students, especially in hallways with lockers or classrooms. If this hallway chaos was brought into the stairwells, students would be even more inconvenienced than having to walk to the other side of the second floor.

In fact, this system is so effective at reducing traffic that the school is changing its hallway policy. The BASIS Gazette is proud to announce that in order to further reduce hallway traffic, the current stairwell policy will be applied to the entire school. This change will come into effect next month and will apply to the entire school.

Under this new policy, every hallway in the school will be one-way, greatly reducing congestion and allowing for fast movement between classes. Due to this new unidirectional feature, students entering the North Cafeteria or the southeast hallway will be unable to return the way that they came. Instead, students should exit the building through one of the conveniently located outside-access doors and reenter through the main office.

To further increase the ease of movement, students may only move counterclockwise around open spaces such as classrooms and cafeterias.

Starting next month, the Gazette will be showing its support for the new policy by remodeling the crossword puzzle. All future puzzles will have the “down” section removed, so they only contain words that go across. As a result, they will be renamed “acrossword” puzzles. 

Additionally, the online version of the Gazette will no longer feature bi-directional text support. The unnecessarily multidirectional letters “x” and “z” will also be replaced with the more flow-friendly letters “l” and “o.”

Thank you for understanding and supporting the new policy, and keep a lookout for nelt month’s issue of the Gaotte!
