<h2>Internet Advice for Major Decisions</h2>
<h4>By George Yang</h4>

Recently, my family was celebrating my brother’s entrance into college. At the end of the buffet, my brother's fortune cookie posed the following ominous warning: “not having a goal is worse than not reaching your goals.” 

My brother is not the only recipient of this caution; almost every senior hears a thousand times the question, “What are you thinking of majoring in?” While most high school students know that their adult acquaintances are merely attempting to spark conversation, rather than asking for a specific answer, students still feel a strong obligation to reply with something more definite than “I have no idea.” Perhaps the pressure to determine a major as a senior or junior in high school is unnecessary, and the indecision of every high school student is warranted.

Lydia Frank of PayScale, a website which researches average job salaries, notes that 30 percent of students now live with their parents after college because of financial hardship. Moreover, the average student holds $38,000 of debt. It is hardly a wonder; the Department of Education reports that around 60 percent of undergraduates take six years to graduate, instead of four.  

Most BASIS students expect to graduate in less than six years—indeed, cashing in AP scores allows some students to graduate in three. But most BASIS students' minds are the same as those of their national counterparts when facing the mammoth of declaring a major: they decide to be “undecided.” According to U.S. News, 80 percent of undergraduates switch majors at least once. Furthermore, the accredited prep book company the Princeton Review finds that the average 20-year-old switches jobs around every three years. 

Indecision seems to contaminate all aspects of life. However, though the symptom is indecision, the remedy is not decision. In this case, the urgency of the dilemma does not demand hastiness of action. Indeed, students are probably deciding their major too early, not too late. The statistics are clear, but how to determine a major?

First, one should simulate potential majors. Lynn Jacobs and Jeremy Hyman, authors of numerous books on the college process, explain that one should not decide one’s major based on one’s love of a single teacher. Eventually, one may encounter a mundane teacher, but the student will still be required to do well in the subject. Rather, one should sample many advanced courses in the potential future major. The authors at Princeton Review promote internships—anything to replicate living in the college environment and dedicating the majority of one’s time to this discipline. A major, after all, requires a dedication of around 40 hours per week, according to Tori Reid, blogger. To test your dedication to the desired subject, spend 40 hours per week studying that subject over a school break. As Reid explains, sometimes one realizes that “turning a fun pastime into required work makes it just that—work.” 

Additionally, majors should be manageable. Jacobs & Hyman write that indecision should not translate into a collection of multiple, unrelated majors. Such a shotgun approach multiplies the work; students often feel overwhelmed and sacrifice their grades. As explained on Scholarships.com, the major you choose should compliment your natural abilities—there is a reason you have strengths and weaknesses.

After considering what is manageable, pursue one’s desires. As trite as it seems, many individuals major in activities they dislike, gritting their teeth and plowing through to reach the better future centered on an idealized career. Unfortunately, that job often never comes. Brian Burnsed, assistant editor at NCAA Education Reporter, explains that it is better to follow the path of your passions, despite uncertainty about where it might lead vocationally. As Israel Wachs, engineering professor at Lehigh University notes, most jobs require far more specific experience than what is taught in even graduate school. He emphasizes that employers want analytical thinking and the ability to learn, rather than a surplus of knowledge. Today, the professions in demand are at the whim of a dynamic economy; the jobs and skills needed now may become obsolete in the future. 

Anxiety only clouds making a decision about a major. One should not be anxious in deciding a major. Gianna Sen-Gupta, reporter for the Huffington Post, notes that most colleges provide students with ample academic advisers and career counselors to help roadmap students' college life.

But perhaps the most astute observation was made by Bittercookies, on Tumblr: "I'm not afraid to fall in love [with a major]. I'm afraid to fall for the wrong [major] AGAIN."
