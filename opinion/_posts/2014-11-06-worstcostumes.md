<h2>Halloween’s Worst Costumes</h2>
<h4>By Nichole Kyprianou</h4>

October 31 marks a day filled with costumes upon costumes upon costumes. Some Halloween costumes are amazingly crafted  and meticulously realistic (the Grim Reaper, Tutankhamen, even baby pumpkins). Others, however, don’t quite make the cut. What follows is a thorough (though not comprehensive) list of some of Halloween’s worst costumes.

1.	Hitler costume – Anything reminiscent of Hitler, such as his moustache, hairstyle, or Nazi symbol, falls under the category of most offensive costumes a person can wear for Halloween. Although Halloween is a time to dress up as spooky characters and monsters, emulating the man who was responsible for the genocide of 5.5 million people crosses a line from which you can never turn back. (Note: Dressing up as other equally offensive characters/groups of history – the KKK – is entirely discouraged.)

2.	Writing “This is my costume” on a plain white T-shirt – Seriously. This costume idea is incredibly lame, and it is obvious that someone waited until the last minute to think of an idea for Halloween. It’s much better if you don’t wear a costume at all. (See previous article.)

3.	Dressing up as a mummy, using toilet paper –  Not only will the costume most likely unravel on you, but wrapping yourself with toilet paper will make you one of the most unattractive people at a party. 

4.	Toilet costume – While one may think this might be an original idea, the idea of walking around with a toilet seat is more disgusting than scary. People will more than likely question your hygiene and your sanity.

5.	The overrated ghost costume- a.k.a. cutting two holes in a sheet and putting it on your head – No costume has ever been more overdone than this costume idea. Unless you are between the ages of five and ten, this costume idea is no longer cute. Sorry.

6.	Prison uniform – Looking like a runaway convict will probably do you more harm than good. If you don’t want to run the risk of attracting the police and getting yourself arrested, please don’t do this.

7.	Milk carton head – A failed attempt at comedy. Putting your face in place of where a missing child’s would be is anything but hilarious. Not only is the effect of the costume borderline offensive, but a milk carton for a head is not particularly attractive. To anyone.

8.	Human Big Mac – Of the most awkward and unforgettable costumes to wear, this one rounds out the list. Not only will you have trouble maneuvering around dressed as a sloppy burger, but this costume will also turn you into a super-sized advertisement for McDonald’s. 

9.	Christmas tree costume – Expect many groans and other sighs of exasperation. Not only will it be hard to get through doorways, but it is also evident that you cannot distinguish between holidays. Halloween is not Christmas! Get your holidays straight, people.

Following the guidance of this review and not getting yourself stuck in any of these sub-par costumes will ensure you a Merry Christmas. Oh wait, I meant to say Happy Halloween.
