<h2>An Ill Wind in the Sunshine State</h2>
<h4>By Yash Pershad</h4>

Merriam-Webster defines a mechanical fan as “an instrument for producing a current of air as a device that consists of a series of vanes radiating from a hub rotated on its axle by a motor.” As complete as Merriam-Webster usually is, the dictionary seems to have missed that a fan is now also a source of political controversy in Florida’s gubernatorial race. 
	
On October 15, incumbent Governor Rick Scott and former Governor Charlie Crist were set to participate in a televised debate on issues important to the citizens of Florida. Crist, citing the need to be “comfortable,” placed a small, black fan underneath his podium to prevent perspiring during the debate. Gov. Scott believed the presence of this fan violated the rules of the debate because it was an “electronic device”; Gov. Crist claimed to have permission to use the fan. 

When the debate was set to start, the fan remained, blowing as steadily as ever. A hilarious debacle ensued. After Crist walked onto the stage without his opponent, the moderator awkwardly explained the situation to the bemused audience, which began booing. Crist began to deliver a speech to the audience, but was stopped because he was not allowed to speak without Scott being present. While the moderator aimlessly rambled about how this never before happened, the former governor looked cool with the help of his fan. Finally, Scott walked onto the stage to a mixed response.
	
Even if this specific type of mischief of the political process was a first-time occurrence, this petty behavior is not new for politicians. Whether in Washington D.C. or Tallahassee, our elected officials are constantly fighting silly partisan battles or arguing about a mechanical fans, while the country spins in its wheels. 
	
Other than providing considerable fodder for some great wordplay, this situation also is a microcosm for the behavior of those whom we trust to run our great country. As Americans, we are learning to blow off the incompetence of our elected officials. Perhaps it is time to end this trend and elect officials who, rather than argue about fans, are fans of improving America.
