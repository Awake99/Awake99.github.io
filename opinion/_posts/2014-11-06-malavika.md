<h2>Malavika's Musings: To ED or Not To ED</h2>
<h4>By Malavika Krishnan</h4>

Being a senior at BASIS necessitates receiving thousands of emails reminding you about last minute standardized testing, hundreds of college brochures in the mail that have been steadily collecting on your desk, and dozens of open browser tabs loaded with profiles of schools you’re not even sure you’re applying to. But even after picking schools which are the right fit for you, there is another decision to be made – should you apply under the Early Decision (ED) plan or hold off until later?

As most college-bound students know, there are three overarching categories that encompass the different ways you can apply to a school – Regular Decision, Early Action, and Early Decision. In particular, the Early Decision plan requires that any student applying under the agreement commit to attending at the undergraduate school if admitted, no matter the aid given by the school. Though applying ED is an inherently binding contract, most students seriously consider this option in the hope that it will increase their chances of getting into the school of their choice. In fact, according to the Common App’s executive director, Rob Killon, 51 percent of high school seniors applied under an Early Decision or Early Action plan in the past year. 

With so many colleges publishing the vast difference between regular acceptance rates and their early acceptance rates, it is easy for students to assume that there is a statistical advantage in applying early decision. Vanderbilt University published a 22 percent early decision acceptance rate this past year, compared to a 13 percent regular decision acceptance rate. Of the University of Pennsylvania’s early applicant pool, 23.9 percent were granted admission, compared to a 9.9 percent regular decision acceptance rate. 

What students often fail to recognize, however, is the caliber of the students who are applying early every year. The Early Decision application pool is often much stronger than the Regular Decision pool, and colleges often tell students to be wary of this before automatically assuming they have a better shot at getting accepted.

Northwestern University’s Associate Provost for Enrollment, Michael Mills, points out the quality of the early decision applications the university received this past year. Northwestern did admit their highest number of early applicants in 2015, but it is also important to note that 91 percent ranked in the top 10 percent of their class, and the combined math and critical reading scores of over a third of these candidates were over 1500.   

As we ask ourselves whether or not we should apply to a school under the early decision plan, it is important that our reasons for doing so surpass merely a published early decision acceptance rate. Maybe you are the student who has had a dream school for a while and wants to get her application over with. But if you are the student who likes multiple schools or is unsure of your current financial situation – Early Decision students must be comfortable with the level of aid they will receive – there is nothing wrong with taking a little more time to decide where you want to commit to spending the next four years of life.
